screw higgins"This game has consumed me.EDIT: This is the cure to all the extra free time from work closing for Corona"I'm not far into the game, but so far I'm enjoying it. The NPCs are charming. It's the sweetest post-apocalyptic game I've encountered so far, and the story is nice as far as I've gotten.Fun and engaging gameplay. Not unlike Stardew Valley, but with Engineering.just like Harvest MoonAmazing Game, try it."Its a 3D stardew valley, its pretty awesome. would like a coop mode though. "Very awesome game. The storyline is really great tooAwesomeFun af. You don't have a 10 minute daily schedule each day like in stardew. That thing ruined stardew for me. Here you can do what ever you like and get things done.
