"His beard grows. In real time.BEARD. GROWS. Oh, and there's a vast, beautiful, open world to explore, stuffed with interesting sidequests and amazing graphics, but who cares about that?"
Over 1000 hours and I still don't know how to play Gwent.

"It's strange how the main game, Gwent, is hidden in some kind of wierd story-driven RPG. The RPG is okay too I guess."
"When you finish this game, it feels like you've broken up with a girl."
"Triss Merigold makes this game awesome.I really enjoy having  with Triss.She has a very hot  and some incredibly firm .But I can always find a way to pound my big  ...... into her exquisitely beautiful .-pack of wolves start chasing me-runs through small village to lose them-wolves start attacking villagers-have to save villagers-kills wolves, saves village-checks if kid who got attacked is ok-kid tells me to off"
Never heard of The Witcher Bought it Prerelease cause of the hype Played it. Loved it. Cry in bed because I finished it. Played it again. Addicted.In Therapy at the moment. They say i will never be happy again.- Beautiful graphics (seriously)- Runs smooth on a mid-range machine- Top-notch atmosphere- I haven't seen boobs yet
"*Actual Initial Impressions* (will continue to update)- Performance on my system has been better than expected (50-60fps  1080p). I am running postprocessing and the majority of the graphics options on HIGH. I have the hair-effect turned off as it does degrade my FPS.- The world feels alive. From the wind blowing through the trees, to the dynamic weather system, to the wild life running through the forest, nothing stands out as generic or as an asset that was placed into the world without thought. The first two areas are more organic than any other game I have personally played.- The side-quests are varied and offer up much more than fetch this or kill that. Many are investigation based and require multiple steps to complete.- The UI has taken a MASSIVE step forward from The Witcher 2. What was once a clunky mess is now fairly intuitive and streamlined. There is room for improvement, but clearly the developers have learned from their past mistakes.- The graphics are beautiful, but please don't expect a fully modded Skyrim or iCEnhancer GTA4 level of detail. Again, the developers seemed to be more concerned with making a world that feels organic and vivid than throwing 24k textures on everything. It's the art, color, and texture cohesion that really makes the graphics standout from other titles.- The dialogue and voice acting are on par or better than most action RPGs I have recently played. I have yet to encounter two NPCs that I felt were using the same voice actor. The only generic voice in the game is probably the protagonist, but that is by design.- I have not encountered any bugs worth mentioning. Zero crashes and no broken quests is impressive for any game when compared to other recent major releases.- While the soundtrack and game ambiance are very well done, the game suffers from sound balancing issues. For example, at certain times the sound level of voices will be much lower than everything else in the world, forcing you to read the subtitles.- There is an overuse of ""stage setting"" mini-cinematics, especially if you play in short bursts and load often. There should be an option to skip these and instead be able to read the suggestion text during a loading screen.- Level progression has been quite slow which has forced me to back-pedal a bit from the main quest to play catch-up. This may be by design, but placing you into an area that is for level 7+ while you are only level 3 isn't the best choice IMHO."
"Bottom Line: I will continue to play The Witcher 3 for the foreseeable future. It offers a blend of DA:I and Skyrim-esque gameplay with it's own unique lore, dynamism, and atmosphere that is truly enjoyable. Please feel free to ask any specific questions in the comments and I will do my best to answer them."
"It's like Skyrim with guns, without guns."

The Witcher 3: Honest Review
"People who are worse than monsters? Even more naked girls? Superb voice acting? Mind-blowingly good storyline? An amazing 1st DLC, worth every penny? An even better 2nd DLC? "
"I have never played a game quite like The Witcher 3. You literally feel like you are Geralt, and you become connected to all the characters asif they really were your family."
"I would highly recommend The Witcher 3 to any RPG/mass content hungry gamers, it is a masterpiece."
