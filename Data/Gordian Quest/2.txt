Any negatives I might have have been talked about in their discord server as something they are looking in to/addressing or are part of the road map."Playable currently improvingGame is very clunky. Its understandable since this is early access.Worth it.A very, very nice card/battle game.. Not too complex or anything but something which is easy to pick up and yet hard to put down when you're playing it.. A real time sink for true fans of this card/battle/rewards genre..
