I've been stuck at home due to cancer, in constant pain 24 hours a day for the past 5 years. I can honestly say, it only became bearable when Total War Warhammer came out. Thanks to both this and the previous game, I've managed to put up with it. I am a huge Warhammer fan, and not only have the stuck to the lore wherever reasonable, they have filled out improved pieces that Games Workshop never really touched! (zombie pirates anyone?)
The first game was amazing, and the improvements of this one shows the developers actually listens and implements some of the suggestions of the community. Not to mention the modding scene at the moment is incredible, as is the support for them from the developers. I have a couple thousand hours on this, and can't recommend it enough!

Welcome to the wacky world of Warhammer, enjoy your stay.
Kind of ruined the historical titles for me.
My most epic Total War: Warhammer moment: When my line of Chaos Chosen was about to charge into enemy line, one guy screamed “BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD”,and then the whole army continued “SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE”
This game has ruined strategy games for me.
The sheer quality of Total War: Warhammer II is why it's hard to justify playing Three Kingdoms. It's why Civ doesn't do it for me anymore. It's why as I creep towards 200 in-game hours. I haven't touched half the content on offer.
This game has an embarrassment of riches available to the consumer. Although buying into the full playset can be very expensive. The base Total War Warhammer II comes with four races. The Lizardmen, Skaven, and elves both High and Dark. This alone is a lot of content. However, if you own TW: Warhammer I, then all of that games races and DLC are playable in a massive 50 hour campaign called Mortal Empires. This is a highly satisfying game mode which CA released for free. As the game currently stands, just before the Huntsman and Beast DLC which marks the third small DLC and fifth overall for Warhammer II, there are around 20 to 30 legendary lords (each representing a faction) to embark on the Mortal Empires campaign. There is also the smaller Vortex campaign exclusive to Warhammer II factions. There is just so much content here for players to enjoys, but it does come at a price.
To buy Warhammer I, II and all of the DLC at full price it would cost over $100. Now there is over a thousand hours of content in the game, but it's a hard ask for someone to put up all at once. When buying, you have to remember this DLC released for a very popular couple of games over four or five years. Some packs are worth more than others. The prophet and the warlock unlocks some really important units for Lizardmen and Skaven, and isn't bad at $8. The Grim and The Grave though? I could live without those units. The curse of the vampire coast unlocks three factions, a new race, and campaign. This is pretty valuable to spice up the game after a lot of time with it. However, older race packs like beastmen and wood elves struggle to provide value for the cost other than having the race itself.
My suggestion for someone interested in this game is to buy WHII. You find a race you're interested in and then buy that lord pack. If you like Skaven, buy Prophet and Warlock, if you like high elves, buy the Queen and the Crone. It will add valuable units to your favorite race and new lords. Then over time add to the game as you want to do other things. Grab WHI and it's DLC when it is very cheap on sale. You probably will never actually want to launch the client other than trying out the old world campaign. (Which I hope they revamp and add into WH III)
However, once you have all the content (including the loads of free content) then the full playset that is Warhammer II feels like one of the most expansive strategy or board games ever. It's enough to keep you busy for endless hours. And if you're me, possibly make other strategy games seem lesser by compassion.
One thing I will nitpick is that diplomacy is limited. Three Kingdoms does it much better and I hope that is the something CA brings over when they do TW Warhammer III. Also, turn times are very long. Like make a cup of coffee between turns long. This is something CA also needs to address in the next game.163 hours later, I've finally beaten this thing. It's a beast -- a sprawling grand strategy game full of nuance, lore, and emotionally engaging content. The AI is much smarter now. I had about a 100-hour learning curve, bouncing between different factions and trying different tactics until I really figured out how to play the game. This thing is amazing. I have to put it down for awhile so I can go get the million things done that I've been neglecting, but here are some pointers:1. Gain as much control of your continent as possible, as soon as possible. Make sure you can recruit some sort of troops anywhere in your empire, so you can quickly sprout new armies in the late game.2. Grab as many towns that produce your strategic game-winning resource (scrolls, tablets, etc...) as early as possible. Garrison these towns, and defend them.3. Station armies in your ritual sites before you start the ritual (bad guys show up fast), and have an additional army right outside the gate for reinforcements.4. Don't march armies of less than 20 units. Don't garrison armies of less than 20 units. As soon as you stretch yourself thin, this game devours you. It's better to march three armies from town to town than to try to take three towns with three armies in the same turn.5. What I did, in provinces: Minor settlements: garrison building/economy building/growth Provincial Capitals: Specialty and military buildings.6. Have a plan. Your plan may vary, but here's a good plan: Reinforce the crap out of your starting continent. Once it's nice and fortified, go forth and conquer. It will cost a lot to invade another continent. Don't give in to the temptation to build a bunch of economy buildings in your newly conquered territories. You'll need to build new armies on these new continents, or you'll quickly get kicked back into the ocean. So build some recruitment buildings when you get there, and start up your economic expansion as soon as possible.7. Buying interventions to attack your enemies is expensive and not very effective, especially late in the game. What's more effective is to grab up as many strategic resource sites as possible, garrison them, keep armies there, and outpace the enemy to the end. That said, if the opportunity presents itself to take the other guy's capital city, it's very satisfying.8. It should go without saying, but skill up your generals to buff certain types of troops, and keep those types of troops in his or her army.9. Old Total War tricks don't work (for example: lay seige, retreat when the army inside sallies, army follows you and attacks out of range of reinforcements, you kill that army... yeah, that doesn't work anymore).10. Squishy troops stay squishy. Abandon all hopes of buffing up your weakest troops to someday be amazing. Build the highest level troops you can afford to build and maintain, and skill up your generals to buff them further.11. It's better to fight them over there, then to fight them over here! Keep your homeland heavily fortified (2-4 armies at your capital city, 2 for early game, 4 for late game). Maintain a robust economy, so that you can quickly field strong armies, and keep strong armies stationed around your continent. Once you've established the TWWH2 equivalent of Fortress America, send your armies to kill the bad guys on their own continents. Late in the game, I played a continuous game of take three colonies, lose one colony. It sucked losing colonies and generals, but it distracted the bad guys from attacking my homeland -- which they could've conquered if I hadn't have divided their focus.12. Don't forget to trade. Trade is awesome.13. Get rid of all troops and generals you don't need. Use the gold you save to build and deploy armies that are needed elsewhere.14. The game is very well balanced, so doomstacks (19 dragons, etc...) can lose to their tactical counterparts (spearmen, for example).15. Fighting Skaven sucks, because they constantly ambush constantly, and pick off your armies one at a time. You will love life a lot more late in the game if you just murder them all early in the game. Early on, they're pretty weak. If you let them take substantial territory and get a solid economic base, they'll become a huge pain in the butt. If you can kill them all early without fighting a war on two fronts (again, don't stretch yourself too thin), DO IT. They get truly awful later in the game.
And that's all I've got. Good luck! It's a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.
There's been a lot of talk since November on the discussion boards involving uninformed consumers not understanding how this iteration of Total War works DLC-wise. For that reason, I'd like to take a second to tell you, the potential customer, what you're getting into, and why I still feel it's worth it.
This game is expensive. A bit more than the DLC list lets on. In order to get the full experience out of this game, you need to own the prior Total War: Warhammer and its DLC as well. This allows you to play with the factions from the first game and the factions from the second game in a map encompassing both games in a campaign called "Mortal Empires". You do not need to have the first one installed to play its content in the second one, and you do not need to buy the blood pack again. They just leave that out of the initial release so they can market it as T for Teen. Take that, ESRB! But yeah, off-sale, at the time of this review (2/14/2018), you have to spend
to play the whole game. "Sheesh," you must be thinking, "That's a steep entry fee!" Well, I doubt you buy games off-sale these days (I know I don't), and it's important to know that not all the DLC is necessary. You could get by spending $74.38 for 1 and 2 during a sale (TWWH2 usually goes 10% off and the original 50% off) and picking up the free-LC that came with the first installment. If you participated in Make War Not Love 2018, you received The Grim & The Grave DLC for the first installment free. If you want to play Greenskins in Mortal Empires, I'd recommend having The King and the Warlord as well, as it provides you with early-game armor-piercing units (Nasty Skulkers) and a lord tailored towards goblins, who are probably going to be a good chunk of your early armies (and, if you're Skarsnik, your armies through the entire game). That's all I usually use, since most of my hours clocked are on Bretonnia, a free faction from the first game. Even then, that's no small chunk of change, and it begs the question, "Why is it so pricey?"
Don't Blame the Developers, Blame the Publishers
This is probably the only way Sega agreed to make something so in-depth; anything less would've been either not funded or would've faced serious cuts in content. Keep in mind that the end goal is to put every tabletop faction from Warhammer Fantasy into the game as a fully-functional, playable faction. CA wanted to make the whole game, so they were forced to piece it out. By piecing it out, Sega could gauge interest (by the first one) and retention (by the second one), each time having the option to pull the plug if they thought continued investment would not be profitable.
Does it suck? Yeah, strategy's a dying market, and while it's nice to see a big publisher at least try to give it attention, they want the results they see in other genres here. I've been lucky enough to receive most of the series as gifts; I've personally spent about $100 on it and have what is currently the full collection.
Considering I've gotten almost 800 hours out of the two, I think that's a fair price (about $0.13/hr). I spent about that much on Warframe when I was into that, and my friends frequently drop that same amount on gacha games.
Even divvied up like this, there's still some noticeable omissions, Mods make short work of that, though. Kislev, while primarily still an Empire reskin, can be led by Katarin the Ice Queen; Averland, by the Mad Count; Parravon, by Cassyon. The Southern Realms have a fairly high-profile rework that I'm partial to as well. Games have been partially developed due to time constraints for a long time, but modders always rise to the occasion.
Unfortunately, one thing that doesn't seem to have a fix in the works is the fact that there is no naval combat. According to CA's representative on Reddit, Grace, "Naval combat will only be in autoresolve. Warhammer Fantasy Battles is principally a game about land warfare, so that’s where we’re choosing to focus our efforts in terms of full battle simulation." So if you were that one guy in Shogun 2 who got hyped every time his fleet got intercepted, this might not be for you.
I honestly believe CA has a strong passion for doing this franchise justice, despite everything that's been thrown at them. It shows in the little things, like the flavorful faction mechanics and the strikingly honest dev diaries. With how well this game is selling in revenue, judging by Steam's "Best of 2017" listings for "Top Sellers", I think this game is going to be supported for at least the next year or two, at which point it will continue to be supported partially in the form of Total War: Warhammer III's merger of 1, 2, & 3's maps and factions. Eventually, we'll have access to CA's dream from the start: every Warhammer Fantasy faction sharing a world together.
Other people have probably said this better than I can. If you've played Total War, you'll adapt quick enough. Magic slaughters clumps, monsters fill an infantry support role similar to tanks in the 20th century, and the threat of death from above further pushes the ranged meta the series has always been a bit guilty of. Once they close in, though, melee fliers can tear through most archers, definitely meaning they're worth their salt.
