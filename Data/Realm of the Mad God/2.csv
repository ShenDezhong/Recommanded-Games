"This game is stunning. The live-time online gameplay is great, the dungeons are numerous and unique, the rewards FEEL rewarding, there is little to no lag, it's easy to master, and teamwork is mandatory. Hardcore gamer or not, you will love this free-to-play game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I loved this game, until I kept being pushed to buy things just so I can move on and become as other players were, just like many other F2P games it incorporates way to much real money, where as this game would cost well over 100 dollars just to be good and not have to rely on a giant group of players to get through things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a solid game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People complain about how you can buy so many good items in the shop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a good game & every one should try it if you like to have adventures & roleplays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not toooooooo shabby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oryx ♥♥♥♥♥ me

9/10 would play again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awesome game!
Perma-death adds a serious aspect to a game that seems to be a casually played game.
The people that play this are welcoming: the stronger players will usually give you something to help you on your way.
It does have some pay-to-win type stuff, but not too strongly; You can use real money to buy coins, which you can get special armor or weapons or pets or whatever with.
Very fun to play with a group of friends.
If you see a Corrix anywhere, make sure to say hi!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For a free game, it's not too shabby. Though, to put it nicely, there are more microtransactions than game support. As long as you can download this game, play it with some friends, and get atleast 10 hours of fun out of it, then I reccommend downloading it and giving it a try.


On another note, I would not reccommend spending ANY money on this game, for if it leads to a misfortunate loss of what you paid for, you will most likely not be getting it back.

As I said before. --Its fun. Its free. Yes, you should give it a try. Just don't get attached.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a very well designed game, that can be lots of fun even without paying any money. As a casual player you need some friends to play all the content,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I relly love this game cant say anything more just taste it :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I own a mac ive played the game a good amount of time now but my screen turns completely black when i try to join beholder or something like that help please?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Realm of the Mad God is the first ever free to play Bullet Hell MMO.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/10 would skip school for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it down? OR IS IT JUST ME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all in all a decent game offering a newer look on the bullet hell genre. The rogue aspects make the game rewarding but also very unforgiving. The game In my opinion is good, but the game seems to be turning more and more into a pay-to-win free-to-play game. I have enjoyed it, but at times when I was doing so well , the game gliched and caused my death. A good game that in my opion lost its vision, not completly , but enough to turn away a lot of players",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well it's free, so it's worth downloading to see if you like it. If it's your kind of thing, you can get at the very least a good 10 hours out of the game. After that it's good to play on and off when you can't find anything else you fancy. All in all it's great for a free MMO, but I wouldn't recommend putting money into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a hard, addicting, and fast paced mmo with standerd pixel graphics; ""Realm of The Mad God"" has a differnt approch to the rouge-like genre. Great with friends and will have you screaming in anger, this game is a fun one. though the weapon controls are a little bit dodgy and it tends to get repititive. 8/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love it! I covered a lot of hours playing this game. I like the graphics. Only downside is the shop in game..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is really fun to use and play.

Small size for an amazing game aswell as it's easy to pickup and play!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fun, but make sure you have good specs and internet or this'll lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Games nice but needs to be polished in some areas like when youre running and shooting the movement to the other direction is delayed.So Far This Is My Only Complaint!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
