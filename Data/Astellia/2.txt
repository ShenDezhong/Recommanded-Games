"This game is a tuypicak Korean miocropurchase scam. On EU server, all players in the game are asians and moslems, 99% of them from germany and france - only moslems and some chinese. If you are European - DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Game is gindfest anyway that only people who earn money to feed families in asia play this for AFK 24/7 and thern sell gold. This of games should be banned outside of China and Korea. "its really fun.It's a Traditional Theme Park MMO, but it does a few things better than other's i've played.nice pet system,i love this gameIts worth the base price for sure. other than the pet system noting ground breaking. But still having fun with it also its very solo friendly. wich was a plus for meits a good game :) buy and see for your selfits a good game :) buy and see for your selfPretty good game! So far worth the money and fun.Decent classic mmo to play till something better comes out,the most positive is that is no pay to win for a kr game.BUYER BEWARE Read this before buying BUYER BEWARE
