Wonderful ARPG! Surprisingly fantastic with a controller. I highly recommend this game for anybody who's looking for a Diablo-like game.goodLike titan quest but better 10/10Great ARPG!I have waited a long time for a Diablo style game, and finally found the best one so far!Fantastic Diablo-esque game. I love the dual class system.This is the best Diablo 2 Clone I have ever played. Truly fantastic.This game is megaAs long as you have a good gamepad or mouse to bind keys to you should be pretty good to go. Everything D3 should have been. The dual class element and nature of items lends itself to creativity while not being too complex. The fact you can refund everything for cheap is amazing and prevents you from getting paralyzed from fear of allocating points incorrectly. They really knew what they wanted this game to feel like, and they nailed it.
