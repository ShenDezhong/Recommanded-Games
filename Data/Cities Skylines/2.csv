"If you want a great city sim then this is the game. big maps, great graphics and realistic trafic ect."
Best city builder there is by a large margin.
Took a while to figure out this game but it is a lot of fun once you do.
"Buy this game because it's good. Also, it's a huge middle-finger to EA. This is what SimCity 13 should and could have been."
"This is the best game every, no more buying simcity any moreÿ"
I'm pretty sure I had something really important to do today.
"Really great game with great city, traffic mechanics.If you are into City building, tycoon games or Sims series - this game is definetely for you.I thought I would enjoy it but I guess I've played too many racing and rpg games and I find this a bit boring for myself.Still there is nothing bad I can say about this game - it's great."
Best city builder I have ever played!
"not bad ,easy to play,easy to have fun"
"The best citybuilder in a very, very, long time, and way better then Sim City 5. Almost everything in the game is executed very good, and the things that are not that good or just missing at all, are fixable through the Steam Workshop."
"Holy shmoly, I just bought this and played it for 11 hours straight.This game is so damn good that it addicted me in the first few minutes. Being a city planner is pretty cool and since Sim City 3000 it didn't feel that good.After building the first two cities, which I ed up, I kind of got a nice big city, 33.000 citizens but sadly there are hefty traffic problems. The game difficulty scales well with complexity and you can do a lot of stuff.I think I'll pause for a few days though because I got things to do and I think I wouldn't survive a few 11h game sessionsÿ"
"Interesting sim city clone, start small. The mistake I just made is make a road across the map, and throw every kind of building everywhere. Oh it was chaos everyone was lack of water/power outages etc was giving me a headache. Gonna go back to mankind divided and ill pick this up again later. Right now my brain is fried from trying to salvage that hot mess I made golly"
Very addictive
Great game!
i love it. i just can't get enough
"Cities Skylines is the best city builder to have appeared in a long time. The game comes loaded with all essential simulation and construction systems, and any shortcomings can/have been fixed by the insane amount of modifications available in the steam workshop. The game is not perfect, but is a close to a 10/10 as you can get for this genre, especially thanks to the mod support from both the community and the developer themselves."
"I would truly love this game if it doesn't crash my system or freezes every 15 minutes into playing. It gets so horrible at times, I have to save, exit game completely and then re-enter, only to find it would lag/freeze again 10 minutes later. I have Alienware which I purchased 2 years ago with juiced-up graphic card/ram, etc I even went as far as calling system support to make sure I have all the specks needed, and checked ""can I run it"" program and everything seems fine. Could you please let your subscribers and I know when or if this issue would ever be fixed? I do not have problems playing other games, even Simcity ran smoothly for me. Thank you for your time and hope to hear or see results soon. "
amazing game best city simulator i have ever played
Excellent game!
"A great city-build game. Can try many thingsout and be creative in the way how you treatyour citizens and workers in your town. WellI became the unpopular mayor trying to screwtheir lives, all of them have 15% happiness XDYou will manage the pollution and traffic problemsin the town most of your time, so be ready tohave mind blown. Planning roads your biggestchallenge too.Graphic is okay, background music is not impressivebut i can deal with it. Very nice city-build game to go.You will never notice how fast your reality time passeswhen you are playing."
"absolutely brilliant game so many great thing to do in it,ive put a lot of time into to it (which i mostly enjoyed)the only thing wrong with this game is the traffic AI which i hope will be fixedoverall i give this a 10/10"
Great game from a publisher (and developers) that cares about their products and gamers
"I SERIOUSLY LOVE THIS GAME, JUST OMIGOSH PLEASE, OH DEAR GOD PLEASE, MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT A LAPTOP CAN HANDLE. IF POSSIBLE PLEASE ADD SOME SORT OF SETTING FOR A LOWER RAM OR MEMORY COMPUTER ANYTHING."
Excellent game.
If you love city building this is the game for you!
"This is an amazing city builder, probably the best I ever tried. At this price it's a must buy"
"Cities: Skylines has made a game answering most of the desires Simcity fans really had for the lastest EA/Maxis debacle, and at a bargain price. If you enjoy city design and mods you will enjoy this game and I reccomend buying. The mods are making the city simulation aspect even better by the month. If there is anything to knock about this game, it is the fact that the budgeting and city management aspects are not as indepth or complicated as some might hope. However, the design aspect, transportation planning and of course mods more than make up for it. Great job!"
"Great Game with great workshop support for unlimited fun with tons of mods and custom in game assets. I have been playing ever since launch and I still really enjoy it,"
Its' a very well done game. It's challenging without making the game impossible.
The best sim City game in my opinion. I highly recommend it!
