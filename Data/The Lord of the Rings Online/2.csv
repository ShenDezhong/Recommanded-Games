awesome open world mmo its worth trying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Highly entertaining game,awesome story,great potential, but in my opinion ruined by the laggy new expansions and the lack of dev interest in bringing anything new to the pvp side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Altough it did break my computer, i did enjoy the brief amount of time i spent playing this game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty good!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the name says it. You can experience the world of Middle earth yourself and still have fun while exploring and doing all sorts of unique quests. This game never gets old.
8/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this game was great, i had alot of fun playing it , though item space could be inlarged a bit but other than that i would reccomend playing this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love this game. Joined for free in 2012, and haven't looked back. Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doing the free version and so far it offers enough to keep it interesting. Very similar to World of Warcraft so the learning curve wasn't too tough. Still might do the subscription but for now I am satisfied with what's available for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I recommend this mmorpg to all who like classic role playing environment and a mature, serious style. I play lotro slow and not hard core at all so for me the environment and the storyline is important. Technically the graphics is not the latest but the environment is somehow cosy and neat. That said the design of the races are totally dead and stiff. Since I have not reached end game yet I can not tell how good it scales. So for me lotro works well as a relaxing mmorpg.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very Fun MMO. For any Lord of the Rings fan, I recommend this title. While it says it is free to play, if you are looking to really get into the game, expect to fork over the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Im so badass until lvl.17 till i leave my computer on with this game running.Worst mistake i ever made.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I start up this game I would get excited just to step into the world of Middle-Earth from killing a wolf to slaying trolls riding a pony to taming a warg living in a hut to building a castle LotRO is my kind of MMO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just keeps getting better and better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really good gamplay for a free game, definitely worth playing. the help section is pretty horrible and needs work, so when the game doesnt work you pretty much have to figure it out for yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So far so good, only got a few hours in this game but I'm enjoying it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its good but takes a long time to update/install. Also it can glich so you have to restart, but if all goes well its a fun game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have been playing it for years! Amazing game!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"people are nice, graphics are not all to fancy, but that's not neccecairy. even if you are a free to play, you can still reach nice stuff. people who think you have to pay erverything might not have noticed that certain achievements give you a bit coins for the shop. so if you work hard enough you'll have enough coins for a mount or something cosmetic. even a free player can buy a house and maintain it (you'll just have to work a litle harder for it) so people nagging about ""oh no it's free to play but you need to pay to do annything"" might be a bit blind. i admit, the beest stuff you'll have to work realy realy hard for (believe me i did that) but still, this game is one of th ebest free mmo's i've ever played.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Really fun MMO, however if your looking for the Full experiance it does end up costing you quite a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is so much fun it's got good graphics and everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Downloaded the game played got to level two said the game was a bit crap and then got attacked by fan boys then banned for 7 days.... BEST MMO EVER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like getting inside JRR Tolkien's head. 10/10 would bang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Lord of the Rings Online is a fun adventure that expands on the LOTR Universe. It is one of the few MMO's that I keep coming back to time and time again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excellent game but does take time to get used to, graphics are not the best but the story and the world of middle earth are enough to keep you intrested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The part where I have to save Avorthal is Impossible. Can't figure out how to solve it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
