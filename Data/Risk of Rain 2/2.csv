No one will ever read this but I recommend this game,,,,,,,,,
I had a run that was so long Teleporter bosses stopped spawning,,,,,,,,,
Actual point of a sequel that adds new game mechanics, items, characters? Check,,,,,,,
No microtransactions, lootboxes, etc.? ¥â¥â¥â¥éng Checkmate. Mate.,,,,,,,
Oh hey, its those lizard guys from the first one, but 3D now!,,,,,,,
Oh hey, its those capsules from the first one, but 3D now!,,,,,,,
Oh hey, its those items from the first one, but 3D now!,,,,,,,
Oh hey its that annoying jellyfish from the first one, but 3D now!,,,,,,,,
Oh... OH! ITS THAT FEELING FROM THE FIRST ONE, I can't wait to play this with 3 more people!,,,,,,,,
"Risk of Rain 2 dangerously skirts ""must own"" even on day one of early access. A very", very good sequel that ups the ante of its parent in every single way. It is insane that it's currently two for one on release; it's easily worth its asking price at the moment.,,,,,,,,
I usually don't write reviews for games, but I had to make an exception for this. TL;DR at the end,,,,,,,,
Risk of rain 2, henceforth ror2, is a multiplayer (or singleplayer) 3D roguelike, bullet hell game. It¨¹s difficult to put this game into words for how unique it is, but that¨¹s what makes it a great game.,,,,,
Starting out you only have one character unlocked, however, you very quickly unlock the rest of the cast through playing the game normally.,,,,,,,
The game offers you three different difficulties: Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon.I find that the difficulties are perfectly balanced. Rainstorm offers a nice ¨¹normal¨¹ experience, not too easy or hard. If you want to relax and be laidback, then drizzle is perfect for that. And, if you want a real challenge then you can get that through Monsoon.,,,,
The mechanics are easy to grasp, and learning the game is a breeze. That¨¹s something that was very noteworthy for me when first playing this game. I had zero experience playing the first game, yet within 10 minutes it felt like I already knew enough to succeed in the game.,,,,,,,
For being in early access, the games gameplay is already almost perfect.The only thing I know that would immediately improve the experience of the game would be fixing the bugs, which I will get to later.,,,,,,,
The current soundtrack of ror2 is rather small.. Although, all of the songs currently in the game always fit the theme of ror2 so well, and always sounds like it¨¹s the perfect song for whatever moment I am. I look forward to tracks they¨¹ll be adding in the future,,,,,,,
There are currently 6 stages that can appear while playing. Each one is beautifully landscaped and easy to transverse and to learn the layout of. With the design of enemies, you can quickly tell how big of a threat they are from looking at them, while also being distinct enough to recognize what it is. They did a very good job on this aspect. When things start to get hectic, you need to be able differentiate what is what, and they accomplished that.,,,,,
I was surprised by how well done the multiplayer was. It¨¹s very easy to get into a game together, I found that difficulty scaled really well. The only problem I encountered was one of my friends DCing part way through, and they were unable to rejoin once their internet fixed itself. However, they allow you to play with each other with mods, which I¨¹ll touch on next.,,,,,
While still small, the mod community is starting to flourish. The devs officially support modding of the game, and actually separate users based on if their game is modded or not, which helps to mitigate anyone modding to appear in your quickplay lobbies. Some of the current mods include:,,,,,,
I would like to preface this with: The devs are currently aware of the bugs in the game and are working on them and will hopefully be patched out soon.,,,,,,,,,
The current bugs in the game, while not too gamebreaking, can be a hindrance. There are only a couple of bugs that I myself am aware of, which are:,,,,,,
Spawning in and falling through the floor, respawning and taking damage.,,,,,,,,
Game goes on so long enemies stop spawning. Takes roughly 200+ minutes,,,,,,,,,
Unable to stand in certain parts of the map,,,,,,,,,
Infinitely falling (I haven¨¹t encountered this, but have seen clips),,,,,,,,
As I said before, all of these are known and they are working on them.,,,,,,,,
TL;DR: All together, this game is a masterpiece. THIS is what early access should be. A really solid experience, active listening from the devs, consistent updates and acknowledgement of the community, and a drive to create a better game. I¨¹ve enjoyed every part of this game, and there is a lot to it. Engaging boss fights, interesting achievements, addictive but not grindy gameplay, multiplayer, and wonderful devs. I can¨¹t find a thing I dislike about this game. It was all beautifully executed and very well done. 10/10
Risk of Rain 2 is one of the best Rogue-lites I've *ever* played. The characters are great, the items are great, the levels are great and they are working on it diligently. I can't wait until it's complete. Oh, and co-op. Yes.,,,,,,
