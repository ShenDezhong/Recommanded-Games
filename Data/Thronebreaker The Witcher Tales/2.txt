Great game, but it bugs me that I checked out Gwent after playing this and now you're locked out from getting rewards for playing and buying this game, because you would have to buy it from the GoG platform to get those. This also means theres advertisement for buying it in the other game even though you own it, and a group of "contracts" or achievements you simply cannot get unless you repurchase it from GoG.Even though it's just a card game, the story really gets you. I enjoyed this game thouroughlyWitcher universe, Gwent card game, building army. So goodLove the art, the voice acting, decision making and art of the game. Kept me entertained till the end. FOR RIVIAChallenging enough, nice learning curve, mostly. A nice little game.Beautiful and immersive.Came for Gwent, stayed for narration.Amazing and challenging card game. But do not get fooled by the marketing of Geralt. 8/10"If you love the Witcher universe, you'll probably love this game. A fantastic story that is really well written and exceptional voice acting. I really enjoyed this one, it seems like CDPR can do no wrong. I wouldn't hesitate to jump into this one if you are into story games, especially if you love gwent (there is a lot of gwent). "The core of the game is discount gwent, cut up and shrunk down.
