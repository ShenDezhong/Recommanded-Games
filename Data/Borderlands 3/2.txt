Story is trash.Good game,"- Buggy mess - co-op is barely playable with no match browser like the previous games. Micro stutters and frame rate drops even in single player. Tried turning settings down, still no fix.- I hit quick search for co-op and was able to write and edit this review, still no match found. Literally unplayable.- No low-gravity areas like Pre-sequel so mid-air slams are pointless."The main story line is not great"The story is garbage. From plot wholes to missing scenes.Lots of bugs, mouse often has calibration issues with using SMG's"If you liked Borderland 2, you know what you're getting. However, everything is little more refined. More evolutionary than revolutionary, but there's nothing wrong with improving on a formula that works!Tough nut to crack, a lot has improved since the previous title/s but there's a lot of issues toothe gameplay itself is great fun and has really expanded on the core gameplay of the previous games.I loved the gunplay, the graphics, the bosses and the car combat. For me personally it feels somewhat like a downgrade from BL2, the gameplay itself is very much improved, all the guns feel nicer and the new manufacturer traits are all fun, but the story is abysmal, the UI is probably the worst I've seen with all the menus being pretty
