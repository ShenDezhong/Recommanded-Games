"This is a good game I love it.... I played it so much that in one year already have 2000 hours on it. It's pritty fun and it's even funnier when you play with friends but like all games it has some bad things like some issues with old computers but if u have good computer or a ""ok"" computer you'll have a bunch of good times. 8/10 ;)"
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the games I classify as an ""Everybody"" game. What I mean by that, is that everybody should be given a chance to play it at least once, whether it be at a friends house, just to try out, or even to play full session."
"TF2 is a free for all multiplayer FPS game. It isn't the stereotypical ""shoot everything you see"" game though. This game has nine playable classes to choose from. Every one of them has a unique aspect to them. I'm not going to spoil them for you, as a better approach, you should watch the ""Meet The Classes"" videos to get a better description of them. Every class also has their individual weaknesses. Whether it be the Sniper and the Spy, or if it would be the medic and the soldier. Though the community isn't really based upon the defaulties of the game. They're are purchasable items that everybody and you even, will most likley want at some point. The hats. The coats. The accesories that that one person had that you wanted, but he just killed you and went on his way etc."
"Resting my case on the items, they're are many styles of gameplay one can take on, making the game have no really OP(Overpowered) people in it. Team Fortress 2 focuses heavily on skill with the individual classes, and while the classes have they're own assortment of community made weapons to choose from, they're is still always something to over-counter it. The characters are stupid and funny, each having they're own remarks that make you chuckle and continue playing the game, just to get the full effect of it, whether it be calling the Heavy Fat(out of rage or jokingly) or insulting the engineer for sitting on his ♥♥♥. This game is a fun community made masterpeice and I highly reccomend everyone who plays on pc to have played this, at least once. You won't regret it. 9.5/10"
I remember when this game come out i was like this game is crap today this is my favorite game after csgo <3
its a gud game i like it lolololololololololololol
Very Fun I recommend it.
"I really enjoy playing tf2. It is a really good game to play with your friends and to have fun! If you enjoy slaughtering people or setting them on fire at least XD! It is really really fun and the graphics are amazing, its really fun to play with your friends! You can also create your own server when your under the same wifi so only you and your friends are on a server with no one else to annoy you XD! There also many different public servers you can play on, and so many different type of modes! It is one of the most popular games and was easily my favourite."
"Valve has made another crystal gem of the gaming word. This is a late review of this game. I wanted more insight before I went to review this game. When I first started I was that f2p noob that we all hate. After 500+ hourse of Mann up, and payload. I love this game (hence my profile picture) and everyone should play this atleast once in their life."
Great fun but has been dying.
It's free! But be prepared to run into a very annoying playerbase.
"I love this game, there is really something in it for everyone: From turning your enemies into a ""fine red mist"" with the sniper, to backstabbing people dancing the conga and even joking about DRINKING JARATE there seems to be an endless supply of random stuff flying out of the mouths and weapons of the game's unique characters. There is really no FPS like it. Sure console games like CoD and Halo have better graphics, but can you stick a rake into the head of an invisible person on Cod, can you hit a person in the face with a giant neon sign on Halo, I think not. As well as the brilliance of the actuall game there is, of course, a fantastic community hub that goes with it that makes this game a masterpiece. A rating of 10/10 is too little for this game and 11/10 is just copying someone else's idea so I am going to give it 134x123672637257`9829128686986986968ffssd986698968as69s8d67sa9s868/10. Didn't just headbutt keyboard with excitement."
I DID BEATA THIS GAME IS AMAZING
"pls valve listen to community. thx. ; - ; otherwise gud. also buff demoknight, fix the quickiebomb launcher."
"l love how its cartoony but l cant run it very well l lag and there is alot of framerate droping, also it crashes alot"
"Amazing game - a FPS that dosnt bore you after a few hours. it is peerfect, combining the jokey nature of all 9 charectors, while still being a challenge in game. they even have a survival mode, MVM, Mann Vs Machine!"
Team fortress 2 is a classic pc game with a large amound of players playing at every hour. in team fortress there are multible classes all with there own weapons and abillities that changes the flow of gamplay incredibly. You can even unlock items that go to specific classes that make them even better and more fun to play with. Pick a class pick a team (red or blue) and battle to your hearts content leading to hours and hours of fun.
