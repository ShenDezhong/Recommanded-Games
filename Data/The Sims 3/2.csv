i love the game only one problem i think there is more DLC then what steam is giving out i think there are like 20 or so and on here there is only 19. please add the rest if there is more
yes is amazing and its like real life!
"Awesome NON-Stop game that once you start, you wont stop! (Hint: the Non-stop)"
i love this game
BEST GAME EVER i love it there is a lot of fun in it
I love simulators and I can make my sims live how I want!
This game has brought me to over 500 hours of time wasting. I regret nothing.
I loved this game because there is so much to do and it is quite a lot like real life. I also saw how all the sims got better and better. The expantion packs may be a bit expensive and I think they should be cheaper but the sims 3 is one of the best games i've got. I disliked how expensive the expantions were but they are add ons. I liked every thing about the actuall game just because EA must of taken a lot of time and effort to get the sims to this level. Thanks for reading and hopefully you will buy a very very good game. 
the sims three is a great game that allows you to create a totally customizeable new life. from creating an awesome character and getting a great job to getting into a relationship totally good
Obviously an amazing game but not for slow non graphical computers as i would probably set your graphics card on fire.
Great fun.
"The best game in the Sims franchise. It has an organized and intuitive play system, well bodied and fun expansions, and not to mention the widest variety of occult sims and towns/locations. The downsides are long screen wait times, repetitive music, and poor use of ""create a sim"" (CAS) customization sliders. Overall it is a great game and worth the buy."
"The sims was always and i think wll always be a frun game. I for once didnt cheat and it actually became kinda dificult...so i went back ot cheating. but, it is a fun game and the customization is amazing. Wish i could maike my girl sexier thoughh"
"The Sims 3 is a game with simulation, and if you want simulation this is the right game. The sims is a game were you can relive your life how you wanted to live your life, and if your life is perfect this isn't the game for you. Their are also Expansion packs. If you don't know what an Expansion pack is it's basicly more things to add to your game, for instance Theirs pets, surernatural, island paridiso, High end loft stuff, And more. So I hope you consider downloading the sims 3!"
"I'm such a geek! I love The Sims, been playing it since 2001 and even beta tested the failed Sims Online.... I can't wait for The Sims 4 and well is single player but creating my own perfect world without the drama is just perfect and maybe just maybe you live in my game too."
"Awesome game, but my laptop has been acting a little funny lately so the Sims 3 is being a little laggy. Hopefully it fixes itself XD"
"A game where Hitler, Shrek, and Carl Fredricksen from Up can be in the same room."
Such a good game and so many things to do
"I wish you could switch between active households easier, other than that I love it!"
WASTE OF MY TIME
"its one of the best steam games a played so far *cough* 3rd *cough*, i was going to get the sims 4 (not on steam) then i saw sims 3 cheaper, and got it and a never regreted it, it doesnt have as good graphics, but its a lot less glitchier, and makes more sense, lets just say i reccomend it on a rate of 97%"
This game is amazing in many aspects. I would like to warn people at the fact that if you want more styles and gameplay you will have to invest in the DLC's. But I highly believe that it is worth the money.
Very fun game. Me and my lady love this game cause we get to make our character completely opposite of what we are like in RL. I love how my ladys sim doesn't wash her hands after using the bathroom it always cracks me up.
I love the sims and I highly recommend it
Sims is always great! Sims 3 is probably the easiest of the games to play (that I've played so far) and I have put so many hours into it. I don't ever get bored of it.
It's a really good game. Very addictive
fantastic game. Still very fun and could play for hours
its the best game of the best you have to play it
"The best sims to-date. Though YMMV with performance, I've never had a problem with low FPS even when I was playing on my old laptop. Even owning most of the DLC, the game still runs relatively smooth.You might want to wait for it to go on sale though, considering it's 8 years old now."
Good game you play as a person almost like a real life person you have to do the same stuff as a real person. You should try it
