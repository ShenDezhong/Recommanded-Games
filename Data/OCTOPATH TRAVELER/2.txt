"Easily one of the most replayable games ive ever played""Best Dark-SoulsYou don't need more reasons to buy it ;)""This game redefined my life. Sure, gameplay is great and all, but the story, and, more importantly, how the story is told (through the use of a veritable spiderweb of interconnecting hints and subtle cues), is bloody amazing.10/10. Would go hollow again."Great GameIt is a really good dark souls game. Do with that what you will.Dont listen to the other , this game is awesome 5/7"Great game, could use some work with balance though.Also various bugs need fixing, still better than every other game."Souls series is sooo good. If you've played the others you know this too. Now that I beat the game I'm running again with a new challenge for myself where i stay embered the whole time to let the invasions drive me insane lol I'm not big on pvp that much so it's quite the challenge for me and I encourage others to try this (if you run out of embers you have to help ppl kill bosses for more). It's a whole new game if you have spent the whole series trying to avoid invasions"Dark Souls back to its best, graphics are beautiful, frame rates high and steady, invasions work like a treat, meaning you have that sense of always looking over your shoulder waiting for a player to invade.Only thing that I was not too happy about was the ending which I felt was lacking espicially if this was suppose to be the end of Dark Souls as we know it.Great game buy it and embrace your death."Absolutely loved the first game in the series. The second I thought was solid. The third feels more like DSI again and I love it. It is nice to play a game that is actually challenging. I actually bought the game twice. Once on console and on PC. Highly recommend this game to those who seek a challenge.
