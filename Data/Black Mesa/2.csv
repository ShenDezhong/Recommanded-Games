Good fun game but not many people play
Game is best 100/10
It's so good it feels official. The developers did a very good job great game.
Highly recommend... This was an awesome tribute to this epic game. Gameplay is tight.. I couldn't stop playing it.
Great game. It really feels like your playing HALF-LIFE all over again.
"Great remix of Half Life. For those who found the original to be too easy, this one is much harder. Reccomend this game to anyone who likes long and hard games with interesting details."
"A fan re-make of Half-Life 1 using Half-Life 2's Source engine. It's missing the very end (a.k.a. Xen), but otherwise it is very impressive! You can tell a lot of love went into this. There's a rare glitch here and there, especially in the beginning, but what game doesn't have them. This game gets better as you get through it."
"Play this game. Doesn't matter if you only want the campaign (then you should probably get the mod instead...) or the multiplayer. This is the best thing I've ever seen made by the community on the HL series, and I enjoyed playing this not only as a reboot of the first game but also as a game that breathes new life into the aesthetic and environment of the Half Life series."
"This game is absolutely stunning. So far I've played 1.3 hours of the game, and I'm in love! The original Half-Life is one of my favourite games to date, and Black Mesa has revived it by adding beautiful visuals, importing the latest Source engine physics and has overhauled things like AI interaction & movement, sound, etc. Definitely a must-buy for any Half-Life enthusiast :) PS I haven't and probably won't play the multiplayer, I am mainly interested in single player games so I have only reviewed that."
"definatly the best version of halflife, it brought to life one of my favorite games ever."
This game was an aboslute pleasure to play through. A Perfect remake of one of the best games ever made. Can't wait for the Xen levels to be released!
Reminds me of good times. Just as good as I remember.
This game is BEAUTIFUL. No two ways about it. They made the awesome HL1 plot shine like a diamond with the remake. Eagerly waiting for the xen levels to be added:)
"Remastered version of first part of Half-Life serie... Delicious. I remember when Ive enjoyed playing this FPS game, it was awesome feeling to kill headcrabs, or bodies that they've affected. Black Mesa, as a fanmade rework of Half-Life is something very good, something... That every single player should try, or in most cases - Return to Black Mesa Complex and get through storyline again. Unfortunately there are some bugs, but game itself makes You to forget about them."
"The most famous PC shooter has been revamped for the better - Black Mesa. This game has always been my favorite since 1998. When people want the definition of a shooter with good story and puzzles, look no further. I have played hours into the original and this one, comparing and contrasting between both games. I have donated this game, with my own money of course, to a lot of my friends probably spending $80 - $100 just to get this game out to people - they have yet to play it >.> When the original mod was released for this game, I loved it - albiet it was free. This recreation has made me love the series all over again. I cannot recall how many times I replayed Black Mesa. This game even includes Steam Workshop - adding original sounds from the 1998 version or just retextures and more! This game to me is worth $20 for fans of the original or just want a fantastic shooter. 11/28/17 - Nominated for ""Iconic Remake"". This game is the upgraded version of the original Half-Life."
"Basically an HD revamped version of the original half-life. The combat dynamic is definitely improved, and the areas are redesigned in a way that not only feels like a fresh and new game but also feels heavily reminiscent of the original. See, THIS is what a remaster is, not additional shaders and crisper textures. I'd love to see stuff more like this in other franchises"
"Though nostalgia is definitely what drove me to make the purchase, this game is still an excellent FPS on it's own. I would almost say that it was more fun to play than the original. In fact, I would hesitate to call this a remake since they've made numerous improvements beyond just the graphics. Many of the levels were re-engineered to better fit the source engine. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game for both those who've played HL1 and even those who haven't."
"Automatic 10 out of 10. If you played the free mod, you should play this version. This version has better graphics (obviously) and it shows instantly with everything being bump-mapped and a option for shadows on props in real time. It had me thinking at points if source would crash with the amount of stuff flying which is a good thing. Only thing I don't like is that some of the textures are low quality like some of the sliding doors."
Worth it! Now for Xen to be made in the next update for Xen! <3 Headcrab <3
"Best HL1 remake ever, cannot wait for Xen Update."
It's not shutting down!
"Good Game, for those who never had the chance to play HL1 back in the days, now its your time of salvation, buy this game so that you can experience the legendary HL1 with much better graphic and sound design!"
"Great nostalgia among all the contents and flashbacks you can discover through Black Mesa. I was like 5 years old when I was first watching my brothers playing the game sitting closely, passing the game 1-2-3-4-[..] times, 14 years later and still waiting for Steam for HL3.. This remake of the game even if in Alpha stage is what you should need for (re)discovering this classic of first-person shooter rich in story/contents/actions/events/and lots more. You can't miss Black Mesa, it's simple, Black Mesa will find you, one way or another."
"The quality of Black Mesa goes beyond being a simple HD version of Half Life, for it is a fine product on its own terms. Despite not having the final chapter yet it provides a good amount of gameplay for both veterans of the original and newcomers."
"Half Life, One of the greatest games of all time. Not very well aged graphics. Black Mesa, Half Life with amazing graphics, and no XEN....... 7/10 Needs giant demmonic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ baby final boss."
"I've played through Black Mesa once it was properly released as a free mod. Still fun, but if the paid version has any improvements, they weren't major enough for me to notice. Pros: It's Half Life in the Half Life 2 engine (minus Xen, which, as you may have noticed, isn't listed in the Cons section). That's about enough to recommend the game. Cons: Same bugs and AI issues from the free version. Physics objects you step on will hurt or kill you. Humanoid aliens generally don't feel like moving to meet you or take cover. Marines, on the other hand, are still unreasonably good at aiming and hella fast at dodging (especially at long distances, where it takes you forever to draw an accurate bead of them - particularly since you can't change the reticule color and it blends into the desert)."
Human allies will frequently stand there and remind you to reload while being shot in the back. I presume the level design is copied verbatim from the first HL (it's been long enough that I can't tell) but copying Valve's HL2 attitude of telling the player where to go may have been better.
Black Mesa is a great game/mod the recreation the voices the NPCS the temptation I always wanted to play a remasterd version of Half-Life 1 and i love it.I don't care if the Xen chapters are not done but i have 1 problem they need to optimize the multiplayer maps but we can wait after all these things they take time.
Waiting for Xen Chapter :)
"When i first played Half Life, i was amazed at the graphical power (at the time) and sometimes would spend like 5 minutes looking at a random zambie that i killed, this game IS MAKING ME DO IT AGAIN!!! WOOP! (love you devs for remaking one of my most fav games of all time :D)"
