i like when the monky shoot the balloonI was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.Great game but would've been nice keeping the idea from TD5 about the houses that give boosts and maybe also have a little more white people think it's weird there are only black onesIt is quite a fun and an addicting game personallyReally fun game when you want to kill some time and not be bored while you do.good game esay to startreally funmany monke eat bana. very nice monkes!!!This is a fun game to play co-op or play solo. Playing on the higher difficulties requires thinking and strategy. You have you think and choose the right defenses. If you like defender games I recommend this.i just really hate ballons okay!interesting game. But I don't recommend to play it alot, or alone, because it gets boring real quick if you play alot or play alone.
