"Ignore all of the positive reviews for this game, the only reason it has them is because the instant you start it they offer you currency for leaving a good review. This game is honestly awful, there is just absolutely no gameplay. All you do is try to make numbers bigger, then click to tell your character to do things while you wait. It's worse than a lot of freemium mobile games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I've been playing this game for a long time now (outside steam).
I really want to give this game a positive review, because it's pretty funny and they update it very often introducing new and exciting stuff but...

...it's a browser game, so I can't. Since it's a browser game it's clearly pay to win (gameforge type of game, where you're allowed to buy diamonds (shrooms in this case) which will let you do three times more missions, buy better mounts, letting you do the missions faster, reset your dungeon timers, boost your guild stats and so on, and so on). I hate pay to win. My friends hates pay to win. My mother hates pay to win. My dog hates pay to win. You should hate pay to win aswell.

Don't do browser games, kids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is really intuitive, simple and very user friendly. I would, in a normal day, downvote Shakes and Fidgets but I have found out where this game truly shines.
Suppose you are a college student ( just like me ) and you are working hardly on your projects or casually studying... Your back is hurting a lot because in the last 2 hours you were copying your pdf's or doing exs etc... and you want to stretch your body for the sake of God. You look at the PDF's again and you think very softly ""I wish I could commit neck rope."" . This is where Shakes and Fidgets actually got me up. When I was casually stretching my back I did a couple of clicks and all of a sudden I did not want to kill myself as much.

All in all, it is a terrible game if you are a real gamer BUT it is a great background app that does not distract you severely while you are studying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free to play, pay to win.

The game is well made, and actually quite fun, you can tell a lot of time and effort went into making it, and I was half tempted to spend some money on it (even though it was clear from the start that this is a pretty blatant pay to get ahead system) but I did the math and worked out that in order to have enough mushrooms just to keep doing the maximum amount of quests daily, I'd have had to spend a minimum of $20 a month (and that's not even considering paying to get the gear advantage from resetting vendors). That is more than you'd pay for any of the top pay to play MMORPG where everything is unlocked after a monthly subscription.

If you get lucky with the random mushroom rewards from quests, and you don't waste mushrooms on anything except extra quests, you have about 2-3 days of actual free to play, after that you have to spend money or fall behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not sure if I've ever stopped playing this game.

Look at my hours.

JUST LOOK AT THEM.

All of my friends are concerned and confused.
It's taken months for any of them to work up the nerve to even ask me what this game is.
""It... must be very good."" they all say.

WELL, IT ISN'T.
THIS GAME IS MEDIOCRE AT BEST.
BUT... I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was good, up until an instance where my game crashed and all of a sudden 30 of my PAID mushrooms suddenly disappeared. I emailed support and and they said they couldn't give me back my mushrooms or a refund.

TL;DR fun game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ customer service. don't bother spending money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The waiting game, you wait, and then you wait, and when you are done waiting, you wait again. you have no agency, other then selecting what you are waiting for

my sugestion, go wait somewhere else",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the amazing Artwork, there is no gameplay here. Unlike other, more recent clickers, there isn't really much to do. The game is extremely grindy and with Grindy I mean having an option to select between one of three quests, although alternating, which comes with a quest reward, a time frame which the quest will take up and how much of your Thirst for Adventure it costs you.

Each day you get 100 minutes worth of Quest for Adventure, after which you can use real currency to replenish the Quest for Adventure or wait till the day ticks over. The game lets you 'work' for the city guard, which basically is just a way to send your character for an hour or two to work, earning money.

More interesting features like Pets are hidden behind a level barrier, requiring you to go as far as level 75 to unlock pets. And you do so by going on the aforementioned quests. At the beginning those take mere minutes and even though there is a fight at the end of it, you have no control over the fight. Just watch your portrait send some cheap effect at their portrait as their (and your) HP bar goes down.

The game is awfully passive, even for a clicker and I think there are better clickers on Steam that actually engage you, even though you only click on things. This game however, is so passive... its boring. Click on quest, wait 3 minutes, click on new quest. Rinse and repeat.. maybe after a few weeks you'll be high enough in your level to unlock Dungeons, pets and other features.

Also when you are told your level 8 character is stronger than over 60% of the populace, then one has to question what the point is of playing. It seems awfully pointless to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ladies and gentlemen, 10 reasons not to play this game RIGHT THERE.
You really don’t need to know any more...
OK combat is joke: You take a quest from the tavern wait while you travel… you can skip watching the fight and collect your reward. So far, none of these encounters have been anything close to a challenge.

The first problem is questing burns through your “thirst for adventure” ( energy ) which grossly limits what you can do each day. This game would be a hell of a lot more fun and competitive if players could just grind the quests. The second problem is there isn’t much else TO DO! The game has more behind another curtain sure… but that curtain is a hard progress gate.

At time of writing this game is about using nearly every dirty trick rather than being a great game, It's a shame Steam has sunk this low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pro:
-comic-like graphics
-humorous texts
-casual gameplay (read: suitable for kids 6+)
-in theory, free to play
-fun for some hours before the Cons get the upper hand

Con:
-it's a waiting game
-P2Progress, you pay or you wait
-without real money, it takes ages to rank up
-basically, there is nothing to do in this 'game'
-PVP combat is influenced by bad RNG
-most interesting content requires lots of rank ups, takes months without buying mushrooms for real money
-gets boring pretty fast
-only for kids, adults should look for more challenging games

Try it for yourself, for me it's not good enough for thumbs up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shakes and Fidget is the ultimate waiting game. You click a bit here, click a bit there, wait, rinse and repeat. It's basically the same cycle of clicks every time. You could call it grinding, if you want to, but I think there's way too much waiting and too mindless to be called grinding. Heck, even games where you can skip scenes/sweep to gain xp, gold, or items are less mindless than literally just letting this game run in the background while you do other stuff. In the 13 hours or so I've ""played"" this game, less than an hour was actually spent with the screen in front of me. It's *that much* of a waiting game. There aren't even any achievements.

It has it's good points as well, I'll have to admit. Art is cute and the text can be quite humorous. But there's no actual plot, there aren't any actual things that you *need* to do to progress, and there's just... waiting. The graphics and aesthetic doesn't make the lack of actual content disappear.

I'll keep it installed simply because I'm that kind of person, and by that, I mean the kind of person that doesn't mind waiting. But I know most people would even loathe to call this a game, satire or not, so I guess Shakes and Fidget is not a game I can recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. the game is massively pay2win. you cannot hope to compete without paying for game currency.
2. the game is basicly sending your hero to a quest.. you watch a timer go down , followed by an automatic ""fight""
and collect gold/loot. repeat until you run out of ""energy"".
3. energy controlled game. but you can of course buy more energy for money.

if you are extremly bored try this out. otherwise , spend your time on a different game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shakes and Fidget is a very fun and compelling game as long as you know what you're getting into. Namely, it's an idle starical free to play RPG. You can go on quests, collect loot, do PVP, and eventually enter dungeons and build a fortress. The game is very light hearted in its writing and humor. It is very much a parody of a lot of modern RPGs, especially World of Warcraft. I like the art style in particular. It's very ... German if that makes any sense.

When you go on a quest, there is a timer that counts down until the quest is completed. And this is where the idle aspect of the game fits in. This is a small game designed to run in the background while you do other things. I usually had my character going on quests in the background while I played WoW and FF14. I honestly have had a lot of fun leveling and gearing my character and pitting her against other people's characters in the arena. And the dungeons are actually tough which is something I kind of miss in modern MMOs! There is a premium currency in the form of mushrooms, but I never felt forced to spend money on any as the game is pretty forgiving in giving you mushrooms as you play, allowing you to go on extra quests or do an extra arena if you so desire. And when you decided you've had enough for the day, you can even assign your character to guard duty so you can continue to earn gold even when you've turned the game off.

Overall, I have had a lot of fun with this game and I highly recommend everyone at least give it a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cons:
Feels like a facebook game. You pick quests and wait for a timer to go down basically.
Microtransactions to speed things up.

Pros:
Nice artwork
Fun writing
Quirky humor

Not sure why this is on Steam? Seems like a really perfect Facebook game. I don't feel like I can give it a positive review because of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A horrible Waiting Simulator that's all about waiting so that you can wait some more, with an eventual hook that's designed to force you to spend money to progress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is a pure time waster. To do a quest, you don't actually do anything, just wait for a timer. It's mainly a grind / idle game. Battles are automatic. Such a boring experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I hit a paywall after 2 hrs of play. If it was a one time thing I might consider paying but it is clearly not. Nvm the fact the game is pretty stupid. You accept quest watch timer run down to complete the quest, that is it YOU watch a clock. But wait you get to watch an entirely automated fight at the end of the timer. This is a cell phone pay2win cash grab save your time and energy for something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still playing since 2009 <3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's been like 7-8 months since i've start playing this game and i can say that i still like it.
It'a a nice game but you really have to do something with server drops. Not a major issue, but let's make this game even better.

No P2W - Only small micros' if you really want to support the team and level up faster.
After all this time i can really say that S&F is one of my fav' games so far.

Good job!

-----------------------------------------------

Perfect game for busy people.
Back in 2007 when i've started playing this kind of games it was a hit. Now, after all this time, S&F reminds me of my childhood and i'm really impresed by the things you cand do in this game after a certain level.

Give it some time and you will not be dissapointed.

Game on!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To be honest I'm confused why this game is recieving so many positive reviews. The majority of the gameplay is waiting. The art style is GREAT and I was even tempted to make screenshots of the loading screens. The visuals are so lively! It's just a shame there isn't more to do. I heard you unlock more things when you get to higher levels but I don't have the patience for that.

[EDIT] For people saying not having patience is a bad reason to not recommend a game: I have played a LOT of idle games or ""waiting games,"" Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, Restraunt City, Adventure Capitalist, and many more. The waiting games I have had the patience to sink hours of my time into, offer LOTS of rewards. Be it upgrades, Easter eggs or achievements... Shakes and Fidget doesn't. A lot of these games have things you can do as you are waiting as well. I shouldn't have to wait until level 60 for a game to get finally get interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
