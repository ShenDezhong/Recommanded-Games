Dopest Game ever.. Tons of tactical strategy. I am a fan of terrorist hunt.
love it!
This game is cool
"I would reccomend this game, however, there a quite a few bugs that still need to be ironed out"
The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t killcams ever.
great game:) realy fun to play mp
just amazing
Just started a few weeks ago. Have to get past the beginning stages to unlock the full game.
"I love this game. It's truly one of the most forfilling experiences I've had in a long time.Be warned however; solely based on the immense amount of errors that the game has, especially with issues such as 'infinite stuck on creating squad' and the '2-0x00000048 error', among others, the game is rendered almost unplayable."
"The game is solid, but that doesn't matter one bit if you can't even enter the menu on startup."
"fun game, very intereting shooter"
If you can hear footsteps this game is for you. 10/10.
its a very good game you meet some pretty nice people on here the teamwork can be nice sometimes but theres sometimes this one guy who wont cooperate 10/10 ign
Só acho ruim a ♥♥♥♥♥ da plataforma (uplay)
good game i love it :D
"Great tactical FPS. Teamwork is important and there is a lot to the game, so don't just give up or judge the game after ten or even twenty hours of gameplay. Find good teammates and squad up...trust me, this will improve the overall experience."
"The game had some problems in the start, and some are still there. However, i will say it have been greatly improved since the release."
"A problem still standing is the matchmaking search. its still pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up, but its better than before. You can search for ages without finding a full team. The bugs with the search is gone tho. I will say the game is worth a buy after all the recent updates. The gameplay is just becoming better and better!"
"Truly in a class of it's own. There is no other game like it that offers the same level of realism and tatical gameplay anywhere. That's coming from a hardcore Battlefield, Arma, and Dark Souls Veteran. If you enjoy realism and tactical gameplay get this game."
"I've been playing for 150+ hours now and I have to say its very addicting. I haven't played any other fps anywhere close the amount i have played this game. Now there are couple of downfalls the uplay servers are really unstable and the constant issue of cheater's (hackers as said in the in-game chat most of the time), but if you can get passed those things then you will have a enjoyable experience. I know its not what they had shown when they first announced it, but they did a solid job despite that and they are updating it regularly."
Good game. Great team based FPS.
Down side it takes forever to load a match
Great game just make sure you have a decent graphics card
"fantastic game XD. the moment to moment gameplay experience is fantastic. Every second of the short rounds matter, walls and floors won’t protect you, and sound tactics win matches. Thumbs up."
"One of the best, if not the best games I have ever played. Endless amounts of fun!"
"The most addicting game I ever played. Yes, the servers are sometimes crap, but who cares. Gameplay is amazing."
"Good so far with less then 10 or so hours, we will see if it holds up! =D"
if they fix the servers than this will be an even better game.
You should buy this game if you are an addict of tactical games. Playing with your mates would be perfect because there are some idiots in this game that make no sense..
"Great game, you may not be able to pull of those 360 head shots, but this game makes you think every move you take, every door you peak threw and ever shot you take. The main reason i like this game as i use to be a big fan of csgo but was put off by the fact every other game you would find a hacker with walls or some s***t but with this i havent seen one hacker yet. Also with csgo you are mainly needed to work together to win the round with this it is a must, means follow your fellow team mate threw any door giving support from behind or attacking on one stop threw multiple entrances."
