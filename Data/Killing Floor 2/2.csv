"Early Access Review that I am MORE THAN GLAD that I participated. How so?....here we go. 1. It works. No crashes on my rig, only minor audio hiccups with mic communications. Performance is great, game looks great, plays great with understandable lag depending on server. 2. What is available shines in all areas of graphics, sound, design, and playability. It is simply fun and satisfying to see and hear zombies coming apart in various ways depending on where/what you shoot and WITH what you shoot. 3. The idea of the game is sound! Lots of unique character perks (playstyles) coming our way that makes sense, plays well, not perfectly balanced, but what is? Lots of unique environments that beg to be explored and discovered. Overall, this a fun game that is so satisfying whether in solo or co-op, with lots of interesting avenues for expanding. Whether it's new weapons, new characters, new modes, new maps, or just simply new costumes and items, this game has a solid foundation to move forward. I only hope that it does!"
Ohhh ok my review on Killing floor 2 early access so far good game improve in every expect of the first one its ♥♥♥♥ing hard and needs good team work to survive mainly on hard difficulty. 3 maps all so far well design to suit the new play style of no camping allowed (first Kf you can just camp and win easy) 4 class fun to play more coming soon and all of them operate and have their own buffs. enemies well they will ♥♥♥♥ you if they get close. Everything stable runs smooth and just about it if you like horde mode games then ya get and i think their going to add more modes for the first time as there is a option to search for other modes which are not out yet and 200 fps reloading which noone can tell
"This game is very addicting. It's very intense, blood-filled and offers pure joy. It's even better with friends."
Really Awesome and i can imagine the full game! :3
Heavy metal and wasting zeds.Nothin beats its
Blood & guts... love it! oh yeah! :D
Straight forward zombie (ZED) killing game. Way better than Left 4 Dead. Pretty goood graphics and corpse launches. Needs mods though and more comical custom maps instead of serious ones.
"For an early access game, this blew the pants clean off me. Even with only three maps and roughly half the perks there used to be, this game is an absolute blast to play! It was only after sinking hours and hours into the game that I started craving a bit more variety--but not from the gameplay. Oh no! This game is visceral to the very core. Enemies fly apart based on wherever you hit them, each weapon is fine-tuned to feel powerful and effective in your hands, and the panic when reloading is absolutely real. Not to mention the phenomenal amount of voice work that has gone into this game, and the kickin heavy metal soundtrack. Everything this game has to offer at this point is polished, shiny, and worth taking home to show mom. There's a noticeable dearth of content now, but it is clear that the team is only going to release new stuff when it is absolutely ready, and I support that 100%. Everything from here on out is guaranteed to be a blast--the new perks, the new maps, possibly even a new zombie or two! I can't wait! I found myself enjoying playing as the berserker nearly every time. Reloading is the death of me, and finally having the opportunity to play a melee character effectively in first-person is something I've been wanting for a long time (well, other than the king of such games, Shadow Warrior). It's rewarding, it's bloody, and I found myself having a screaming good time every time I picked up my modified shovel and started crushing heads. Favorite moment: taking out the last zombie in a wave on a team match by leaping through the air and smashing his head in one perfect, movie-grade strike. Is it expensive for an early access game? Yes. But worth it. Trust me on this: if anything you've read up til now sounds like fun, you won't regret buying this game. I bought it on a whim, and I can't put it down!"
if you loved the first one you will love this one even more better leveling system great graphics would buy for 30 $ all day
"Game is in early access so keep that in mind! Game is actually really good,although it lacks weapons. It does not lack any fun If you ever get bored of the vanilla maps then go on a custom map, lots of custom maps! Classes are fun and great, support and field medic are probs my favourite classes. Weapons are pretty balanced although I think they could use a bit more because support can easily mow down waves of enemies."
"The boss in this game (Dr.Hans Volter) is hard to beat but when you're the last one alive fighting him is terrifying.He's very fun to kill aswell, requires quite a bit of teamwork. Learn how to aim for the head when playing this game otherwise you won't survive long. Always aim for the head. Community is good, higher levels aren't kicking any low levels from what I saw, unless you have horrible lag. Game doesn't have a lot of players however but you can find one, don't use matchmaking atm because it just dumps you into a empty game, use server browser. I hope my review helped with your decision to not buy or to buy the game."
i sliced of a female zombies flaps off... 10/10
"its like cod zombies, with zombies"
"this game is quite good when you clench your butt cheeks, 8 of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Make it rain on the boss after you kill him =Life
I stated in an earlier review that there was a bug and this bug kept the game from working. however this was a bad on my part and i have fixed it. i deffinently recommend it for a gory shooter now and by all means if you like killing baddies and watching them explode in an orgy of blood and organs this is the game for you.
"Basically a totally enhanced version of KF1. I am excited to watch this game evolve with new maps, perks, and weapons. Definitely worth the money. Edit: A year and a half later and Tripwire exceeded expectations. So many new perks, maps, and weapons. And the playerbase is always growing. Excellent game!"
Even better than the classic! 'Tis fun as hell. Literally.
KILLING FLOOR 2 HERE! GRAB IT WHILE ITS HOT!
"Do not play this game if Rhinna, Chris brown, 1D, Justin bieber, Justin timberlake, AKON and Rebecca Black, are in your top 10 for favourite musicians :D"
gore everywhere
BEST GAME SENS TF2 / 11/10 IGN XD
Great game highly recomend getting it
"In this PC port of the hit Wii U game ""Splatoon,"" players work together to cover as much of the map in their paint as possible. The only difference between this and the console version is that all your paint is stored in enemies, rather than in your gun. Additionally, there's a greater focus on co-op PvE rather than PvP, in order to make the game more accessible to casual players. My only complaint is that you can only seem to play for the red team at the moment, but hey, it's still in Early Access."
"Killing Floor 2: So far so good Already in this stage the game has proven to outweigh the original game in every aspect. The new game mechanics feel very fitting and add more diversity to a players game, the visuals are fantastic texture quality and everything else is top class. Audio quality is great overall, the new soundtrack is great yet again similar to KF1; the gun sounds are amazing they feel meaty and gritty making the game feel badass like the game should. Overall already even with limited maps and weapons the game has massive potential and has already suceeded in its evolution to step up from the first game and deserves any positive attention it WILL get."
"Decided to try it since it was free and still in easly access. Its ok but it seems at this point you have to be more team oriented than the first one, which is ok to me. Can't wait to see it finished, as its missing some perks and guns. I will buy it when its released for ""real"". I was having a blast this week-end but I never buy or pre-order anything... its just common sense."
its a fun game but they are taking too long relising content and by the looks of workshop you have to vote for camos and weapons you want in the game if you want a server with over 30 people on open up steam server browser then select killing floor 2 and just choose a server with lots of people on
"awesome zombie game, awesome graphics, awesome ppl THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!!"
Yes If you have friends to play the game with then yes! :D
Plays Heavy Metal music as you explode zombie heads. 11/10 would explode again
