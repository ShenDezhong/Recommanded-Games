The art style is not my favourite, but the gameplay is deep and satisfying.I could play this game for hours at a time on endless and still be hookedIf you like deck building games, this one gives you tons of replayability and unique synergies to play with. It can get a bit crazy. Definitely in a good way.Very fun and endlessly replayable.goodThe game is great, it is a deck builder game with a fun combat system. People who don't normally like card games will enjoy this as well.When I played my first game, I thought it was a delightful Magic-like CCG-soltaire that wouldn't last. Over 200 hours later, I own it on all platforms, and it still feels fresh every time.Very fun game. Addictive and easy to learn."If you like deck building games, this one gives you tons of replayability and unique synergies to play with. It can get a bit crazy.
