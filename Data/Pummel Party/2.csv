"Amazing, especially for quarantine times"
I hated my friends before I played this game. Now I hate them even more. 10/10
My wife hates me now. Thumbs up guys.
I had three friends.
My friend mike has never won a game in this.
"Mario Party, if it were insanely violent and included copious amounts of gore."
"We played with Steam Link, 1 wired XBOX controller and 3 PS4 controllers, without issue."
"I bought this game with the intention to use it for drinking games with my friends. And damn did it pay off. This game is hella fun and the developers have continued to update the game with new features without charging extra for them. Which is something we lack in the gaming industry these days, to some degree. If you are looking for a silly, multiplayer online or offline game to get drunk with your friends while playing then this is your jam. Trust me, it won't disappoint!"
"And if the developers read this, you guys are killing it. Keep up the amazing work, I always look forward to your updates."
"A PC game, with 4-player local co-op (full controller support), that is essentially a more mature version of Mario Party, that largely holds it's own! What's not to like!?! Whole heartedly recommend to anyone who wants party games on the PC."
"A couple small Cons:-Biggest complain is that several games should be longer. Who wants to play a mini-game that lasts less than 30 seconds? Or at least like 5 rounds instead of 1-3. (Mario party also suffers from this.) Or make it an option you can toggle in the menu?-Controls in some of the games could be better.-Not all of the games are amazing, but most are fun, if not great. (Mario Party also has some dud games.)"
Very much looking forward to updates and eventually Pummel Party 2 one day!!!
"I would would recommend this game, but would like to say that I likely would not play this game further until there are some changes.-The mini-games are extremely fun-Rewards being good at the mini-games (maybe too much)-Excellent friendship-ruining simulator-Not enough mini-games!!-Reward system is kind of broken: first place gets the best items (swap, rocket) at a much higher rate making it extremely punishing-No point in playing the elements mini-game until the last 5s as only the last crystal matters-Keys have no use late-game --> needs balanceing, perhaps something to spend them on other than trophies (cannon doesnt count)-Needs more items, probably more utiliy or no-damage items-Maps could be bigger"
"While i do recommend this, changes need to be made to be recommendable beyond several hours. Overall fun, great with friends, and probably the best mario-party-like game out there right now. WOULD BE AMAZINGG WITH UPDATES!"
"Errors found at time of play:-In the one 1v3 game, green was always the 1-With turn order, ties were resolved with who was in the colour order-could not be colour but number (ie. order of joining the lobby)-experience is mainly with pirate map"
"This game is a looooooot of fun. I was impressed by the amount of minigames they had when I bought it, and they've added 14 more after that. There's 42 minigames right now (updating this when they add new). Rebuilt Games is giving it a lot of love and attention still, and they listen to comments and attend to bugs."
"You can play with 4-8 players BUT you can play by yourself and add 3 (or more) bots, no need to have 3 friends to enjoy it. You can even just add bots and watch them play without adding yourself, for some reason. The bots have 3 different difficulty settings. The bots work well and it's satisfying to play with them, although I've noticed them being allowed to cheat in a couple games."
"There's a good diversity of maps that work in different ways, and the board-game side of the game is just as fun as the minigames to me. However, you can choose to only play with minigames if you want."
"The minigames are very diverse, and they bring back some nostalgic memories of childhood games. If there's any games you don't really like you can remove them in the settings."
"I know there's a local play option, but I haven't tried it yet. Online multiplayer works well, but lag can be a bit of a problem depending on your internet connection."
"I really thoroughly enjoy this game, it always gives a good laugh"
Needs more mini games and 1v3 and 2v2 game types. overall is fun.
"Very fun locally and online. It's mario party, but on PC. Only thing this game needs is workshop support."
"Awesome fun game to play with mates, absolutely hilarious. Quite rng based but still a great experience."
Its like mario party but If I win my dad beats me
Really fun with friends.
I recommend buying it to play it with friends.
"If you don't have any friends, don't buy it."
I regret my decision.
