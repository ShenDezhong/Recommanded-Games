"bloody amazing game 11/10 great story, characters, design, perfect OST.can't recommend it enough."2B is my waifuI feel the need to replay this game over and over because I am not appreciating how amazing it is.Came for the thighs, left with the cries.Greatest legs of all time"It's hard to write a spoiler free review for Nier Automata but i'll try my best, mainly because the story is amazing and special and the other thing that might be confusing to some players is that the game doesn't end when you finish it the 1st time and the credit rolls and this isn't like other open world game, it's not about continuing the side missions after you finish your first run, while it may look like a 2nd playthrough it actually isn't, so make sure you are ready to spend a lot of time playing this game to be able to see most of the story, if you want an action game to play for a short time this is for you, better if you play a great game like Devil May Cry 5."You can dodge the bullets, but you can't dodge the tearsnot only is the story great but the graphics even look good through the tearsPlease don't stop playing after seeing the credits for the first time... the game is literally just starting after ending AGood game but how do i fix my emotional trauma?
