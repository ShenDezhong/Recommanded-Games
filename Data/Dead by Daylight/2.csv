"Ok so this game is really fun. Like really fun when you're with a group of friends on skype. The problem is that there are SO MANY BUGS. It freezes, it glitches, it crashes, it takes FOR EVER to find a match with me and my friends. Then when we finally get the game to work, and then after waiting 20 minutes for a match, we finally find a match when guess what? The game kicks my friend for being a cheater?! He's in the same room as me and we hardly ever play this game, how on earth is he a cheater???"
"This game is fun don't get me wrong but its so close to not being worth the minimum of an hour it takes to get everyone connected, to find a match, and to finally get in game."
This game really good. At first i wasent really goning to buy it just seeing the reviews and how no one can join a game but really execpt a few bugs this game is amazing the thrill of being chase bu one of the killers is scary and the joy if your the last person to escape while everyone had died. But playing with friends makes this game 10x much more fun. But one thing I do hate is the nurse. There are 3 words i can only say about her and that is ♥♥♥♥ THE NURSE. She is way to over powered but after a while you can escape her preety easily but it does take time. Being the killer for me is quite fun but can be really hard and sometimes boring but chasing someone is always. If your one of those people who camp the hook and stay there and no... okay JUST NO.
After what i said i can recommend this game a great thrill being chased awesome with friends and a very beatiul game and give it a 7/10
"That said: There have been intermittent matchmaking issues, but the devs have been addressing them pretty quickly as they can. The devs are actively listening to their player audience and striving to make this the best game they can. It's definitely a work in progress, but the gameplay is something good and unique to me and i'm able to overlook its issues because of it as they work to improve. A lot of people want to expect a AAA title out of this because it looks so polished, but look at the price tag. For an indie studio to make this kind of game is pretty damn impressive. Pretty sure that the new friday the 13th game will be good, but this game has sucked me in for the meantime. I even wound up making a bunch of online friends playing this game."
This is an awesome game aside from a few minor animation glitches this game is flawless
"Very enjoyable to play, but the queue has been having problems. (Version 1.1.0)"
This game is a lot of fun to play. The game does have a high learning curve and it takes awhile to level up however I have enjoyed every minunite of it. The devs are pretty good about fixing bugs considering there small team.
Been sitting here for 30minutes pressing ♥♥♥♥ing ready in this press ready simulator with my friends. they should add a queing system for lobbys but that would take away from the immersiveness of you having to press the ready button 100 times before you actually find a game.
"**On a serious note the games many bugs are starting to become very annoying, I still want to play the game but it's just very enraging 80% of the time**"
>game decides to chuck me in the cupboard instead
>instantly dive out of cupboard and attempt to vault over again
>game once again decides to put me in cupboard
"Its a fun game in which you can play one of the survivors or be the killer.There are some flaws with the game like failing to join a lobby and bugs, but still its a fun game and i recommend it!"
"Alrighty, either first or second review, can't remember, so please forgive me for quality issues."
"Now, I review games I feel strongly about, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game."
"So, DbD is a game where 1 killer goes after 4 survivors. As of now, there are 3 killers and 4 survivors. There are 4 survivors and 3 killers, all with unique abilities that they only have. Each killer/survivor has 3 skills none of the others can get, at leats, until they aquire the Learnable version, the orange one."
"The gameplay is very fun, as either survivor or killer."
"As a Survivor, it is terrifying, looking for glimpses of the Killer, having to deduce who the Killer is and what to look out for, trying not to fail a QTE as not to alert the Killer, working with people you find. It's all very well done, overall."
"As the Killer, your job is hunting. It's fun because of how different it is from survivor. You have to hunt them, looking for scratches, looking for a glimpse of them, looking for noises. You have to predict which way they run, so as to intercept them if they turn. While you are faster, they are more agile, and the feeling of satisfaction when you down a survivor, then throw them on a hook to die is amazing. However, it isn't fully done yet, and some balances are off, and the matchmaking sucks. Overall though, really good."
"These really go together. The music is very fitting when used, but sometimes, it's just BGM. Music either idicates that the killer is near you or something like that. Normally, you hear the wind, your footsteps and breathing, or maybe a trap being laid, a Wraith hiding, or a chainsaw cutting through the night air. The sounds are all very good, and both the music and the sounds, together, inspire an atmosphere of terror, making it harder to know what to do. It is done superbly."
"I really can't think of any faults here, everything is done extremely well."
This game really has beautiful graphics. Nothing really to say here.
"Now, overall, everything plays well together. Faults for this game are hard to find! I have to rate it 9/10, because some things could have been done better, but this is still an exceptional game."
"TL;DR, it's worth it. Hell, I would still buy this game at $50."
"Amazing game, the only problem is you cant talk to your teamates in-game"
"This game really needs a single player practice mode to help one getting familiar around the generator QTE, escape route etc.. Great game, not friendly to new guys though."
really fun game. The way the game is atm is really buggy still fun nonetheless
Great horror game ... There are no jumpscares but a lot of scary situations ... Buy if you like survival horror games without zombies and that kinda ♥♥♥♥ !
"Amazing hands down, I will be honest at first I was like you reading these reviews for days deciding if I should buy this game. So many people saying it is a great game but almost just as many saying it has glitches matchamking is broken etc. I will say after 4 hours of play just today I have ran into no glitches besides getting into a killers lobby who has a slow internet connection the game has run flawlessly,"
