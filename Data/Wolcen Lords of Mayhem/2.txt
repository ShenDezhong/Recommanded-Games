My worst experience with an Early Access title. Launched without fixing bugs / QoL issues. Not even worth a detailed reviewBuggy as hell, pretty graphics but technical issues are glaring. This is having played it in offline mode, crashes multiple times each act.So.. just hit level 79 online and mixed feelings about it, cleared 187 expedition a few hours ago at lvl 78Every update seems to add superficial elements with no real development progress. Hold off on purchasing until some real content arrives."I was (and still am hesitant) to write a review for such a controversial game, but, probably 3 people will ever read this, so here goes...Caveats: Never played an ARPG before. Saw the hype, took a chance on a genre I have no prior experience with.""I just have one thing to say.I've backed this game for a long time and you all have the oppritunity to replace Diablo in the spotlight while they grab for cash."This game is amazing. Well, let me rephrase that, this game will be amazing.This game doesn't look like it's going anywhere any time soon and the devs couldn't even give me a satisfying response when I asked on the forum about what was going on. All they did was lock my threads and tell me to look at the plans as if that even addressed my concernsThe devs seems to still struggle in figuring what they want to do with their game and also can't seem to focus on one thing at time, which has lead to countless delays and the game being redone from scratch twice since the early access started 3 years ago.This game never seems to deveop anywhere. in alpha for 2 years now? still nothing but act 1. loosing faith
