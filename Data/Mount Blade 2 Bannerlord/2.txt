pretty funGood gameNeed's more work, but a fine start"This game is buggy as hell, crashes a lot and worst of all there isn't a single companion which has the steward skill, making the Governor system completely pointless.I still love it though, I'm excited to see the full version and also not searching across the whole of Calradia for the ten nobles who were at the Battle of Pendraic only to find there's an encyclopedia which tells you where they are. "I survived to play this game"Missing some key features from prev games-Not quite polished yet"Its okay but i expect more from full release. More diplomacy, more crafting, more politics, more everything. For 8 years of development this is not enough. Waiting for improvment"I have never clicked on a game and paid $40 faster in my entire life.10/10 would do it again"100 pointsI didn't expect to play this game in my lifetime.
