There is a lot of potential in this game. Even though it's in alpha, WHF is pretty fun to play. In its current state the price is a little too much, but I am not going to give this a negative review because of it. The only thing right now that bothers me is the performance issues. I have almost the recommended system requirements and I still have below 35fps + the game freezes sometimes. There is a lot of bugs, which most of them are game-breaking. I have to admit that it's pretty annoying to get so far into the game and then it's all for nothing because of some stupid bug. This is in early alpha, so I had prepared for that. Apart from all this, I am liking this game very much. The bugs don't bother me that much and I can play this game at average 30fps. I am recommending this just because this has a lot of potential and I really trust the developers. I have the feeling that this game will turn out to be even better than expected. I have played this for 15 hours and I still haven't escaped. This is due to the bugs and the performance issues. If you can handle them all, including the price, I recommend this game.
Engaging atmosphere. Graphics are good for this type of game.
You being forced to take Joy is also another interesting aspect.
Like all the others have said, you have to feed and rest your character way too much.
There are also no markers for important quests and I'm not even sure if some of these quests work at all.
I get to the Holm bridge, and it says I need farajay(something like that)'s code and then it also gives me this quest about Constable Turner?! What? They're not even marked on my map and I don't even know where he's located. The quest to get the code to the bridge and advance confuses me. Is it just broken or incomplete? Am I just a stupid person?
Also the way in which I die is really cheap at times. Like for example, the bridge that leads to the Garden's from that happy town has you play a game of Simon Says, and I'm pretty sure it's nearly impossible to complete the last portion of the game. There are 6 lit platforms that you have to step on scattered around the room, and there are spankers to damage you if you're not quick. The spankers I believe can kill you before you're able to reach even the 5th platform.
No help or hints at all about where to get resources to craft essential items.
Overall there are definitely balancing aspects that need to be improved. I don't know how that Simon Says is game was supposed to work but it seemed damn impossible to even reach all platforms before the spankers electrocute you to death. There is also the obvious need to complete and polish the game overall, and to fix the broken quests and add more markers on the map to guide players.
Great setting. Show's amazing potential, but it still needs a lot more work. I would advise most others to hold off from buying for now if you want the chance to experience the game at its' best. Personally I have purchased it as I believe it's the kind of game that wouldn't normally be made and the developers deserve a chance to try and make it work - if you believe the same certainly buy it but maybe hold off playing it for now as you will probably burn through the one off event quest elements that will lessen the experience you could have in the final product given the nature of the game.
The final version will either be an ok game or a really great one. I think now they have the basics in they should actually ignore a lot of other games they have borrowed mechanics from and figure out how to make it it's own thing it deserves to be.
It definitely needs a lot more content, but I would really love to see the setting and behaviours of Wastrels etc really brought into the game more via deeper simulation and behavioural mechanics to make a more alive and bizarrely dangerous playground. The creepy setting needs to actually creep into the game mechanics more to unnerve and disturb you, and add to that off-kilter feeling.
I would like to see more variation in characters that indicate different types of behaviour that you can take advantage of, or be wary of given the situation.
There is some very talented art design behind this game but the quality of 3d models and texture work mostly doesn't do it full justice for a modern game on the PC. Polygon counts for example in environment pieces seem much lower they need to be - even taking into account supporting the PS4 etc. Obviously they have to balance production cost against this and make compromises as they don't have AAA budget. The game does look perfectly serviceable though so please don't misunderstand, and I am sure their art team is working very hard given their small production size. It's more that the underlying art design is SO GREAT that you wish they had the budget to better realise it EVERYWHERE - but for that they certainly need you to buy the game today ;-)
I would actively encourage the developers to aim a little bit higher then I suspect they originally planned with this as it would be worth the sweat and tears to make this into something truly special.
I had a single game crash and virtually 0 bugs. For early access it's a pretty solid game. Very excited for the finished product.
I feel like there should be a way to make items to distract the police at night since there is a numerous amount of them and would make getting around at night a little bit easier. I feel like it would also be a fun addition to the game.
Woke up in a bunker with a scuicide granny corpse.
Ran around for 4 hours doing vague quests.
Finally got across the bridge & died from the plague before entering the city.
Simply put, this game is not as good as the developers think it is - and nowhere near as good as the current price might suggest.
I got this for about $20 on the original EA release (regional pricing + EA Discount) in May 2017. The game is currently selling for 3x that price, or 4x if you include the Season Pass. (DLC and Season Pass were never mentioned when this game was initially launched in EA)
Fraught with controversy since Gearbox Publishing got involved, the only defence from Compulsion Games, is that the game is going to be great... There was massive community backlash from those sceptical, disbelieving that Gearbox could actually add anything of value, and the ratings dropped overnight to "very negative" based on the news. It was saved by Valve's new "review bombing" measures, meaning a month later it shot back up "positive", even though the game had been removed for sale until release. So there are many, many negative reviews that are not included. Despite some very heated discussions, and some shocking comments and passive aggressiveness from devs and white knight fans, I decided at the time to stay out of the way and wait the extra months that were added to the release date to see for myself.
The only really good thing about the game is the aesthetics: the art style, the beautiful world and the "Clockwork Orange" or "Bioshockish" theme. The promising start was fully capitalised with massive marketing, fake hype and MS punting it at E3.
But... bugs aside - and there are so many, including game breaking bugs, the game is all just rather dull.
It is partly a stealth game, but it's just so lame. For example - you can be in a room with enemies trying to attack, and standing right in front of them, you can climb in to an air duct with them looking at you and they all wonder where you have gone.
It's partly a combat game - but again, there are just so many games that does combat so much better.
It has good voice acting, and the story might be good - but I find I have to go back to a save from hours ago, just to complete a major quest that is broken. So it will be a grind of re-runs just to see the story out as it currently stands.
There's so much more wrong with the game, including massive performance issues, dull run and fetch quests, diabolical AI, and although the game looks so good, the world really just feels sterile. Maybe these issues will get fixed, but with such a long delay from the initial release date, the state of the game really is well below par.
I may come back and change my review if they address these issues, but I don't hold up much hope. Compulsion Games no doubt sold out - perhaps for massive financial return but at big damage to their reputation. The target audience are gaming newbies that fell for the hype, that might be fooled into thinking this really is a AAA game and must be great because of the price.
