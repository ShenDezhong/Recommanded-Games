You find yourself stranded on a deserted island, surrounded with nothing but wild animals and collectible resources. What do you do?

Welcome to Ostrofa, where youâ€™ll be challenged to use your survival instincts and combat skills to survive in a randomly generated, low-poly environment, fighting other players around the world!

Food can be found on your or resource islands. Look for apple and orange trees, mushrooms, vegetables, and berries. You can also hunt nearby animals, which can provide a good amount of meat. If you are looking for something more sustainable, there's always an option to create a plant farm or build fish traps!
