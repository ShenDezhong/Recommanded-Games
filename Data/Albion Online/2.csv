"This game is great. Its a hardcore runescape. Then you learn that the entire game is only playable in pvp zones in the late game. Then you learn that the game is only filled with ganking people. Any time you go into these zones, you run into players with far higher gear that is impossible to fight and they brought their friends too. If there was a way to play the game in pve with my friends, I would. I left a while back because everyone of my friends left the game for this reason (8 people). With no people to interact with beyond killing me on site, its pointless. I wish we could play the game without lossing hours worth of grinding in less than 30 seconds. There is my Review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Albion is one of the most polarising games which i played... I read good and bad reviews about the game...
One reason is that its very special and not all kind of players will have fun with it...
Maybe these points help you:
You should consider to NOT play the game if:
- You like Stories and Quests
- You dont like grind
- You expect sandboxing like minecraft
- You like a huuuge open world with secrets to be found
- You like a very friendly world
- You dont like PVP
- You only want PVE content (or at least the choice to)
- You want to play alone...
- You like owning and wearing special nice gear for long time

You should consider to play the game if:
- You like highly competitive pvp action
- Working hard to achieve higher ranks in something is your motivation
- You like economic games where the market is close to be real
- You dont want to spent much money (Premium can be achieved by gaming easily)
- You like action together with yuor guild/friends (farming / pvp / pve)
- You like if skill matters more than money/gear
- You like if battle tactics matter more than money/gear
- You dont like static classes to be chosen upfront


I hope this helps a bit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Founder Since Beta 1, aka the glory days..

Removing content like grottos, nested portal dungeons, harbor towns, black zone cities, etc. really hurt the direction of the game IMO. SBI became obsessed with their consensual/non-consensual pvp and forgot to focus on developing their sandbox elements.

PvP is looked down upon in yellow and red zones, and gaining a negative rep has no redeemable qualities. It takes weeks, if not months to reverse what rep damage you can do in a single day. They had an opportunity to create pirate cities where criminals had to spawn and live out of and form their own ecosystem. A bounty system, if developed correctly could add meaning to the reputation system.

Beta 1 felt so much different than the current state and direction. It was raw and pure, and now it's gone for better or worse.

P.S. SBI will ban your reddit/forum accounts if you harshly criticize their game. They will censor you. You have been warned!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you like PvP, looting people you kill, player driven economies and Moba style combat, you will like this game.

If you are a big fan of PvE content or lore/story-driven games, you won't like this game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is plagued by huge guilds/alliances that monopolize territories to the point where you can't farm or gather the higher tier resources without the threat of being ganked. Imagine being a skinner (Like myself) You go out to the black zone and skin for 30-45 mins until your Pork Pie is up, and you head back with you 200-300 + hides and run into a group gankers that kill you. All that work wasted and now you have to buy a new set of skinning gear, a new weapon AND a new mount. The game is incredibly unforgiving. OH and these giant said guild/alliances will more often than not CHARGE you a fee if you want to join. I have over 401 hours in on this game, up to t8 skinning and am just over the constant anxiety of being killed while I'm trying to have fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I enjoyed it when i first started playing. Its pretty easy to skate through the lower tiers, avoiding ganks, gathering crafting materials, doing dungeons with 2 or 3 other people. But then you realize that ALL endgame content is completely locked down by super massive guilds, so all the skills you have been grinding to grand master are worthless because 60 people camp the highest tier resources. You HAVE to zerg up with people, otherwise there is no point in playing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THIS GAME IS GOING FREE TO PLAY IN APRIL! Just so if you're interested in the game, but not willing to shell out $20 / $30 (off-sale) I don't understand why people are hating that this will be f2p, if youwait you'll miss out on the rewards.

($20 is a really good price imo. You'll get a mount (Specteral Wolf), some gold, and another thing (forgot) when this becomes free 2 play.

[Long review because I see many negative reviews that baffle me, will put 3 sections for this game. Informative, Good, and Bad.]

============================[Informative]=================================

First of all, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take the time to research this game before paying $30 for it. There is a lot of grinding. (Although, they're making it easier with the monthly challenges that give you so many tomes of insight [free xp basically]) This game has a unique artstyle. Its not going to have Black Desert graphics nor can you change the camera. As I see a lot of people care about graphics like that matters more than gameplay. I enjoy the graphics, and they work on subpar gaming rigs / even my school laptop (with around 20ms, playable) you can get this game on your tablet if you manage to get one of the keys to them. (I am still trying)

You can also get a trial key to try out the game up to T4 I believe. Which again, baffles me that people try out the game for >1 hour and complain they don't like it. Don't spend $30 on a game you don't know about!

Gear scales downwards depending on the zone. Arena is also scaled gear down to make it more balanced! So you cannot just wipe the floor in T8 gear while the enemy is in T4. Gear doesnt scale down in black zones where you'll most likely be when you're this far anyways.
pls play arena guys, 40min queue times kill me late at night ;-;

The game is not dead either, don't just follow the steamcharts since there are a lot of people playing on the albion launcher.

==============================[The Good]================================
The good, or what keeps me playing.

+ JOIN AN ACTIVE GUILD IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I can't stress this enough, i was about to quit @ 100hours in because the first guild I was in didn't do anything! Now I'm doing ZvZ's, mages, dungeons, etc! Which then also speaks about the community.

I like the community. I don't see how people say this community is toxic unless you havent played Overwatch / League or you don't talk at all in video games. Nothing new, and its more laid back than other games. Just saying mods are pretty cool and let a lot of things slide in the game. The only time is late in the morning (3AM) when no one talks / other languages than english start talking.

+The grind isnt bad if you know what you're doing. I have alliance members who average 525k fame an hour in dungeons. It helps if you're into a guild and they'll power level you really quickly in higher tier dungeons. Again, join a good guild / alliance and get involved!

+ZvZ's, GvG's, HCE's, Mages, Hellgates, and even Gathering. It all starts to get addicting once you start doing them. Most are pvp, but gathering is like your Runescape woodcutting / mining. Click and watch. Which could be a good or bad thing.

+Classless PVP is the best MMO imo. I hate being locked onto a tank character and then making a new character just to heal. You can really make your own build if you want. (Tank with daggers sure why the ♥♥♥♥ not)

==============================[The Bad]=================================
Thirdly, i want to talk about the ""controversial"" or ""what people like to ""complain"" or give reasons to hate this game

-Premium. Its something everyone complains about. It helps you gather more (Premium Bonus) and gives you Learning Points. Learning Points let you automatically level a skill up once you hit 20% on that level. Its really worth it, and you can pay for it with in game silver too. (Although, we all agree that just spending $10 for an entire month is better since its just 1 hour of work)

-This game is PAY2PROGRESS, I find this different than Pay 2 Win (P2W). I want to explain. I always think P2W was always about locking people out of good weapons / items until they paid for the item. While pay 2 progress is more like anyone can earn the items in game, but you can buy your xp to use the weapons. This may sound like an advantage, but you're not gonna get far in the pvp zones unless you are with a guild anyways since everyone ganks anymore. Which leads to my next issue with the game.

Note:
I WANT TO SAY THE PAY 2 PROGRESS AND PREMIUM IS NOT AS BAD AS YOU'RE THINKING AND I REALLY DONT SEE PEOPLE PAYING $100+ GOLD TO JUST LEVEL UP

- Rarely does anyone solo pvp in full loot. The only time I've been killed by one person alone was when we were both in fishing gear fighting for a lake with bloodletters. You will see gankers and they are common! IF not, expect to be ganked :)

- There isnt a story, which isnt a problem for me as I value the gameplay more but I know others do care. There aren't any quests beside the tutorial to get yourself a Tier 2 donkey.

- My main gripe, not enough solo content. I can't really explain nor give any ideas. But when all my guild members log off. I would still like to do more of the bigger dungeons. The ""solo"" dungeons really arent good fame nor good money. You can go invis and go straight to the boss, its more efficient just killing roaming T8 mobs.


I'll keep comments enabled, I want to see if others agree / disagree. I personally enjoy this game and did get my money's worth. I'll clean up the review and make it neater in the future.
============================Oberon Update==============================

THEY MADE EARLIER TIER (GATHERING / GEAR) EVEN EASIER

Random dungeons - These are actually awesome and a lot of fun.

Lower tier mobs will give more fame (easier to level gear!) I leveld my spear from lvl 6 -> 23 in like 30 minutes - to an hour. Its insane.

New players rejoice!

The random dungeons are a breathe of fresh air, and you better be ready for people to dive in. Its good fame and good money.

"Albion's core gameplay is fine. However, the way some mechanics are implemented are not. I'll go by an comparison to Black Desert OnlineIn BDO, world bosses spawn the same at set locations, with public timers. This is same for both games. However, the major difference here is, even though both games are primarily focused at PVP, BDO forces you to flag for PVP before engaging, even at world bosses. This makes it so that even solo characters are able to get some rewards from the boss itself. In Albion, however, you're automatically flagged for PVP whenever you try to ""contest"" any given world event. This in and of itself, is not a bad mechanic. However, with the way the community is shaped right now, unless you're a part of a big alliance, you won't even be able to attend to the event area, let alone to the event itself. In my 164 hours of playtime with a group of friends, we've never been able to see, let alone do, a world boss up close. Big alliances with 200-300 active members with gear that you could only dream of will raid the event area, knock down ""or kill depending on the area"" anyone that approaches. There is only so much you can do when you're outnumbered hundred to one. This is the only thing that I could say is a problem that is put there by the developers.

The next big complaint, the community itself. Oh boy. It boils my ♥♥♥♥ whenever I think of the encounters I had.

Healers will try to deal damage while wearing DPS armor. DPS will aggro mobs before the tank, die, and complain about the tank failing their role. Tanks will try to focus on their damage before survivability. You will get flamed for playing your role properly. You will get flamed more for not playing your role properly. You will get flamed in the arena for not being able to win a 2v3 while that piece of shid guy who flamed you managed to lose a 2v1. You will get flamed in multiple languages. Your party member which you wiped the whole dungeon with will quit the party the very last second, interact with the chest before any one of you does, gets all the loot and prevents anyone else from looting the chest. It's such a cesspool of ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ that it actually makes me sick. Free-to-play does bring the worst of people from all languages. The community is so full of people that are not willing to co-operate and communicate it hurts.

The progression system is vast and nice, and you're never forced into a single specific path, you're able to train on all kinds of armours and weapons, which is nice. However, the gathering progression is so artificial that it is painful. There are 8 tiers of items and 100 levels of progression for any given skill. Every 10 level is a milestone which you can use the higher tier item, and some of the weapon abilities require you to level up to a certain point before you can use that ability. This is nice, regardless of however artificial it is, because most of the time you will be leveling up your fighting abilities when doing dungeons, and you will be able to wear items that are higher tier before the next dungeon. But gathering is a completely different story.

I've played Ultima Online on and off ever since Age Of Shadows, gathering was-and-is still repetitive and boring but I didn't mind the dull repetition Ultima had, mainly because Ultima's gear isn't locked behind your skill, and regardless of where you did the gathering, you always had a chance to acquire rare material alongside regular materials. In Albion, specific resources only spawn at that specific locations. There are set timers tied to the tier of the resource, which somewhat discourages camping, but still doesn't totally prevent resource campers. What this leads to is, to level up your gathering, you will have to put multiple hours daily to gain a single level and gather that resource, while traveling around the map on a sluggish mount while hoping no one else contests the resource you're after. The math might be off but, to level your lumberjacking from T4 to T5, you will have to do at least gather the highest tier resource repeatedly for 4500 times, with premium, and a matching gathering gear, with the highest tier gathering food buff, with proper gathering RNG that boosts the fame and the yield you get from the resource. It takes around 5 seconds to gather the resource your gathering tier is equal to, starting at T5 resources only will spawn a single size, and the total amount they'll yield is drastically lowered. You'll spend 8 and a half hours to be able to get T5 resource, without any interruptions, with perfect spawns, with gathering gear and with highest tier food buff. T6 should take 30, T7 80 and T8 130. What do these numbers mean? You will have to gather the same ♥♥♥♥ing pixel on your screen, a minimum of 21600 ♥♥♥♥ing times. Lovely right? Also, if you don't own and feed your own crafting stations, which are total pains in the derriere, you will pay at least 200% of what you crafted as tax for the goon that owns that station.

One last thing before I write this game off as a fuccfest. People are clowns. Literal clowns. I've seen people camp at loading zones with 6 perma-CC gear to take down a single guy. When I say perma-CC I mean it. It blows my mind how a PVP focused game allows CC that lasts up to 6 seconds that is AoE. There is no counterplay to zerg-rushers with overloaded CCs. You can't cleanse death.

Also the premium you paid for only applies to that character you bought it with. So good luck jackass.

Avoid it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I feel like I need to preface, this isn't a refund bomb, like some of the dill weeds on reddit are suggesting, I purchased the legendary waste of money edition and play this game regularly.

Albion Online is rather divisive, but not exactly because of the reasons one may think. Many that dislike the game have played it in some capacity and often use cheap shots like ""P2W"", ""Runescape but not good!"", ""mindless grinding disguised as a sandbox!"". These are mostly partial truths designed to get a rise out of those who unconditionally support the game.

To a much larger degree, one which I feel is the core reason this game gets what seems to many as irrational hate is the team behind Albion.They're almost in 24/7 denial and/or damage control even before the game was formally released. Not liking something about the game and suggesting anything other than high praise is met with some questionable behavior. A friend of mine was permanantly banned from the game for asking for a refund because at the time, none of the footage reflected the actual product. This has since kind of changed. They're on par with your narcissist of a mother in law, they want to manipulate everyones perception of them by manipulating those that have a perception that does not fit their narritive.

Now I kind of get it, nobody wants to develop something and have it be returned or critiqued in a way that feels unfair. You're basically watching potential dollars,pesos,francs,euro fly away.

But man does the way a company handles itself reflect on peoples impression of the product. There were so many more people during beta. It wouldn't say its a ghost town now, but it barely feels like it once was.


tl;dr

The team behind this game are all a bunch of knobs and that is the real reason it gets its sometimes embelleshed criticism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The update today, has doubled the repair cost of all items, and added a 50% increase across the board, to basically everything you can do in the game that costs silver. The Devs explained that because of the addition of randomized dungeons, the amount of silver introduced into the game, has inflated the economy. End result, it now costs 50% more silver across the board to do anything in the game, so your silver consumption is increased by 50%. Or another way to look at it is, if you put money on the game, and convert it to silver, your gold just lost a significant amount of its value. This is a blatant way for the Devs to generate more revenue for their game. Your gold just lost its value in silver, so you'll have to spend more money to accomplish the same thing. I guess I'll stop ""sinking"" real money into this game and spend it elsewhere, I would not want to add to the in game inflation.

Another point is this update has really hurt newer players. With the 50% increase to personal island costs, and island upgrades, it will be harder on newer players to do the same thing, veteran players where able to do at the same level. They also increased the re-spawn times for Tier 1-4 resource nodes. They did not increase the amount of resource nodes. This means newer players will have to spend more time resourcing, because your still competing with other players for the same resource nodes, but with greater cool downs.

All in all, this new update really hurts the newer players, and creates a different gaming experience for them versus veteran players not affected by these changes. Way to screw over the new guys!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's Eve Online and Diablo having a child. The child is called Albion Online. I read some bad things about the game so I was not sure to buy it, but it worthed every cent, even I know it's going to F2P. There is a ton of professions you can choose from, you can be really anything. You can earn money with gathering stuff, refine stuff, crafting stuff, trading, transporting, grow vegetables, grew animals, kill animals, tame animals etc etc etc. Full player driven market, and in Eve there are safe, not so safe, and quiet dangerous zones to go out.

There is open world PVP, but you are not forced to do it, but you can pvp in zones where you do NOT loose your stuff, almost loose nothing, and you can pvp in zones where threre is full loot. Guilds can go to islands where they can conquer territory for themselves, just like in Eve.

The grind.. There is, and maybe it sounds stupid, but in the same time there is not any grind in the game. As the advertisment says, you are what you wear.. really. Whatever type of armor, weapon you use, whatever resource harvesting tool you start using, you will continously be better and better and can use higher tiers of that equipment. So, we can say the game itself is a big grind, because there will be always something better then the current one, at least for a very long time. BUT, you will NEVER have a feeling that you need to grind for something better, maybe only in the first 2-3 hours. All your equipment is totally fine whatever you are going to do.

If you are living in a tier 4 zone (its midddle tier) and a higher tier player comes there, you can fight him, becuase his armor, and weapons numbers will be scaled down for that territory.

P2W, some ppl say, and it's BS. P2W is a game where you HAVE TO pay money to get some combat or other unfair advantage, what advantage is not achievable through normal gameplay without using RL money, but in this game everything can be achieved by just playing. You can buy everything by ingame currency, or you can craft everything for yourself if you that kind of player. Money can make your progression faster, but who cares? As I said you can enjoy every element of the game even in mid tiers. I reached tier 4-5 in 24h gameplay.

One suggestion: when you found out what armor and weapon you want to level, then level up to tier 4 in open world killing random mobs, and after that join to a guild, and go to dungeons. Just to dungeons, at first you will get insane amount of money and xp (fame), this is far the fastest way to lvl up yourself.

Have fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am so over this game. As a new player, people are ruthless on here. If you trying to play safe, the undead dungeons get repetitive. There's no sign on the outside of the safe dungeons that it's cleared.. When you want to venture out into the stronger areas to PvE, some a**holes are waiting on the outside of the area and gank you for all your hardearned loot. I'm so over it. It's not new player friendly.

I played this game for 3 weeks, and I'm not recommending this game. I hate it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Game is not for everyone.

You either farm
Or gank
Or play the market

In any way you can do all at once. The game has good content to keep the player in a constant fun state.

Free Game - MMO - people will love and stay - other's will hate and leave - don't get fooled by the mixed reviews.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To put it simply - it's a farm fest.

If you're into that then you'll probably like progressing through the tiers and what not (as there's a lot to go through (like a lot a lot)). But sadly other than that I fear the game doesn't have much more to offer.

Combat so far has been boring and repetative, the fact that you can change classes at will, first seemed cool; But it makes you quickly feel like there isn't much combat progression.

A lot of the areas are duplicates of the previous ones with just higher tier buildings replacing the lower ones (yay for creativity).

Contrary to some of the other reviews the game neither runs poorly (i.e. I've not come across any framedrops or lag) nor is this game P2W. While you can buy 'gold' in game with $ and then use that to get silver or buy some other things (i.e. learning points - which are limited if you don't have premium and speed up learning of skills a little bit), you can buy a lot if not most of the things with the in game currency. The price might be little steep, but if you actually pay attention to market prices and what sells well in what region you can make a lot of money really quickly.

What else, graphics are okay at best (I played at max settings fyi), story and quests are pretty much non existant as it's a game where you set your own goals.

Lots of nice players though! I doubt I would have done my 11hrs if I didn't have few good laughs from the people in global.

The only enjoyable thing I found to do with this game is the ease of turning it off. Stop it. I don't mean it in that way, there's no hate here. Depending on how busy you are you can literally hop in and out of this game non stop without having to worry about anything. It was quite a nice change compared to the other MMOs I've played. Where it feels like I'm bound by something until I finish the quest or get to a certain location..

All in all, it's not a terrible game. I personally do not favour it. But that's not why I'm not recommending it. Simply put, compared to other MMOs out there this game is really lacking. Combat, economy, crafting, skill progression - there are games out there that do all of those better.

I'd personally would suggest getting it on a sale, a big sale - like 75% off sale, okay fine minimum 50% off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The support for this game is absolutely terrible.

Word of warning, if you have bought and returned this game at any point, you cannot re-buy it and play again even if support says you are fine to do so.

I had messaged support explaining my situation, that I returned the game at launch and planned to buy again when more content came out, I heard you get banned for doing so, so I asked if I was able to buy the game again on steam without running into issues stating what I knew. They lied to me and said I can play again if I re-bought the game, they claimed my account was ""unlinked from steam"". This was not the case as I was still banned.

When I paged support to get it fixed, they told me to make a new account to fix it... Keep in mind, you do not get a steam key or anything of the sort to make an account with as far as I could tell. I re-paged pointing that out and they ignored me. I had to make another ticket, and this third support representative told me to try logging in on the non steam client... Again, I have no CD key. I tried it, obviously it didn't work. I relay this information and waited aother week before returning the game a second time.

Around the time my refund goes through, still annoyed, I go to the albion discord to vent. I am contacted by a support representative via PM's and they offer to try and help me. I tell them I'm not going to rebuy the game again unless I am sure that the ban issue is fixed or I can register a new account, however it is messed up. They assure me that they personally took care of it and I should be good to go.

Guess what. I'm still banned, and still can't play. I logged onto my laptop to check and see if it was an issue related to my PC at the request of this person. Still didn't work. They give me a trial code and say that they're going to bed and they'll try to help me more in the morning...

At that point I was just done. I refunded it a third time. They don't know their heads from their you know whats. I will never purchase this game again, I will never purchase a game from this publisher/developer again.

And if anyone doubts any of what I've said, I have all of the emails and the chat logs to prove it. So come at me community representatives I'd be glad to post it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Albion Online is 100% not for everyone. There's a few things you'll need to be able to get past to have a good time in Albion.

1. The PvP is BRUTAL. You will die, it will happen. The sooner you get used to the concept of dying in a full loot zone, the easier it becomes to play. You learn to never take anything you can't afford to lose into a red zone or black zone, and if you have to move large loads you should really try to get your guild to escort you.

2. It's grindy. If you don't like a good grind, you won't like Albion. Everything is created by players, and you need a specific experience level for each different type of gear to be able to wear it (or craft it). You'll spend a lot of time doing monotonous tasks and I do occasionally find myself a bit bored, but I like the idea of working towards a goal.

3. If you want to seriously play this game, you're going to have to buy Premium. A lot of people complain that the game is Pay to WIn, but you can obtain every item in the game by playing it. Premium does make the game SIGNIFICANTLY less grindy though and allows you to level things up much faster plus gives you perks like a personal island. A lot of people are against this because they want an amazing game for the low, low price of $0. I don't mind shelling out some cash for a game that I enjoy though, and I understand that not everyone has this mindset.

4. Lately, there has been some really bad lag. At times, it makes the game unplayable. The devs have said that they're working on it and doing everything they can to find a solution (with the side comment of compensation for those affected coming with the fix). Everyone hates lag, and this is probably the biggest issue with the game right now. Once this is fixed I think the negative attitude surrounding the game will mostly disappear.

Overall, it can be rough and is definitely not for everyone, but Albion Online is a fun game with some very fun mechanics and i've had a lot of good laughs with random strangers across the internet because of it.

P.S.: If you need a guild, Independent Ranger Corps is always accepting new players and is full of friendly people willing to help you learn the ropes of the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the most TOXIC game I've ever played in my whole life, you will never see something like this, people will literally knock you down for hours just to annoy you and show you how powerful they are, but not just one of them there's probably 10 more people willing to ♥♥♥♥ you in front of everybody, for nothing, yeah you heard that right there's some zones where people can ""kill"" you and you will have to wait for 10 minutes to get up but you won't lose your gear, it will just break, some people will literally camp you for hours just to annoy you and they will ask you to pay silver in order to get out of that infinite spam kill, they will also call you ""scum"" and ""outlaw"" because you activated PvP mode in a Soft PvP Area.

Now the best part, black zones and red zones, in those zones you loose EVERYTHING, that's great until you realized how it works, are you a noob wearing nothing but a low tier set that is literally worth nothing to them ? Not even a horse on you? They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ my dude, you are still going to get ♥♥♥♥ed by a zerg of 50 players wearing high tier armor ( because in a zerg you are always confident of your gear) so they can insult you later and make fun of your gear that they just destroyed, yep, they destroyed it.

I saw people getting spawnkilled in the portal (you aren't supposed to engage there..) just because they wanted their horses that is worth nothing to them... but it will be to you.


People will betray you in town, they will make you go to a Black Zone or Red Zone ( new players won't realize it until they die) so they can gank you with their friends, yep you heard that right, they will invite you, play cool with you so they can gank you and steal your noob gear.

Some guilds also invite new players to their guilds so they can set max taxes on you and steal the majority of the silver you get from kills.

I almost forgot, there's literally a whole region controlled by a single player, in this game in order to craft you need to use crafting stations that can be bought by players so they can make money from the taxes collected every time you use their stations while most of them are just 5% or 10% per use, there's a player who bought an entire region and set every single one to 100% tax collected per item and then proceeded to buy EVERY single crafting station outside the city and he converted them to personal houses so people who chose that region by default are stuck paying 100% taxes to that guy and the DEVs don't give a single ♥♥♥♥, it's pretty hard to explain if you never played this game but this guy has literally a built his own MAFIA inside this game.

This game is the humanity in a nutshell, a disgusting piece of garbage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is unfairly rated. All of the negative reviews, or at least most of them, are from salty players that tried the game when it came out free to play expecting to play the conventional MMORPG they were used to. Based on reviews, there are people complaining about the game having no lore or quests, others about the amount of time you have to grind to accomplish something, and some others about the ""toxicity"" of players, because they got killed, lost everything and got trashtalked (it is no surprise that those people have barely a reasonable amount of playtime to have a formed opinion about the game). I also read some people saying that they weren't going to give AO a chance taking to account the negative reviews, and I am sure a lot of people missed the chance to play a really well made game because of this.

These are some reasons I think you should try the game, and also some information:

- Allthough there is a premium system, this is completely and easily payable with in-game currency, thing that I rarely see in other pseudo free to play games that lure you in, and once you reach late game content you have to pay out to be on equal terms with other players. The benefits you get from premium time are rates of progression, more silver gain, being able to buy an island, and monthly unique rewards.

- Whether you want to play alone (allthough some solo players say this playstyle dead, which I disagree as a solo player, forgive the redundancy), group PvE/PvP with friends, or joining a big guild filled with sociopathic leaders that will use you for their own benefits, you can do it and you won't be limited. You will progress faster while being member of a big guild, yes, but is not mandatory - and also, be careful while joining a guild as soon as you start playing, since some guilds have recruiters in newbie towns, tricking new players into joining their guilds with the objective of taxing you passively every time you gain silver

- Free market which is manipulated by players, and every city (6 in account) has its own which work independently. You will see lots of people standing near the markets because of this, your computer won't like it but maybe you will if you like the trader life.

- Punished fast-travel (most of the time not worthy - NPC charges you for luggage) and independant banks in cities, warcamps, houses, which push players for exploration and risk, since you have a chance to get killed by gankers and lose your items (game is full loot pvp based - will expand further). You can still fast-travel for free from city to city, but totally naked and with no items in your inventory.

- I have played MMORPGs which have dominant guilds and it is either, joining them, or being unnable to play. AO has a system in which dungeons (PvE for groups) are generated randomly through the maps, limiting the dominant guilds/alliances to control territories to their whole and making it harder for them to gank you while leveling up. Randomized dungeons in high tier maps with controlled guild territories (these terrys are only a portion of the map) are more likely to get ganked but it is a good way to sort this problem out. Also, you can buy or loot scrolls that open up dungeon maps which are private to some extent (till you or any party member goes in)

- *I consider this point neutral to the extent of a positive review* In AO, you are what you wear, basically. There is a non-class system, allowing you to be and do as you like in terms of leveling, differently than and most other MMORPGS. This means that you can wear any weapon and piece of gear in the game, once you have progressed to the desired tier of the item you want to equip. You do this by equipping it and gaining fame from killing mobs (which is the equivalent of experience). The tier of an item determines how strong it is, being 1 the lowest and 8 the highest, without consideration of item quality and enchantment of course, but won't expand.

- Highly competitive PvP with full loot mechanics, restricted to the type of map you are at. You will encounter blue, yellow, red, and black maps. Progressively speaking and from blue to black, the type of PvP gets harsher, allowing blue no type of PvP and black unrestricted type of PvP with full loot mechanics.

- If you don't like PvP or PvE, you can choose to be a gatherer/crafter/trader. I only do these kind of stuff when I get bored, and can't say much, but seen people having fun while at it. You will have to invest a lot of time though.


Regarding the cons of this game, I can say sometimes servers work badly and you will experience some rubberbanding, and for gameplay I would only reduce the number of consecutive maps with guild territories the game has, but that is just me as a small scale player. Otherwise, I consider AO one of the best, if not the best, MMORPG I have played till this day, it met my expectations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If you do not like pvp, do not play this game. As a crafter gatherer, the game is enjoyable to tier 4 or 5, then you are forced into mandatory pvp areas with possible gank squads in every area. The main trading city is surrounded by mandatory pvp zones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YOOO! I back off this game because of the mixed reviews and steam charts and oh was i so sooo wrong. Not sure how the game was when it launched, but as of March 20 2019 with the dungeon update the game has been awesome and has really begun to fill my MMORPG itch I've had for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is extremely not new player friendly. High level troll guild loom lower level zone to kill new plays. It is extremely frustrating for new player go travel out, get kill by ganker and lose days worth of work.
I wonder how many player leave game after this happens to them?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't play if:
- you don't like PvP with full looting
- you don't like Grinding/Farming
- you feel that a MMO should give you Epic loot by the dozen
- Sandbox games aren't your type
This is like a fantasy EVE Online, where Guilds battle for supremacy and (almost) everything is built by players. Feels like a modern Ultima Online.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This game is NOT for solo players.
If you have a group, try it out - you will be able to decide within the first 50 hours.
After 2300 hours put into the game i can for sure say that it has had its up/down moments.
DISCLAIMER: This game is the definition of GRIND - if you cant take it, dont play it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The familiar screen style of dota and diablo, with the full loot of runescape, and the massive world of WOW. Steams best kept secret. This is a high quality MMO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I like the concept of full loot PvP and wars over territory. I also really like how the gear progression works in this game; probably my favorite gearing system in any MMO. However, the game really needs additional PvE content other than just grinding in dungeons. Don't get me wrong, I like the tension of always having to be on the look out for some random to pop in and murder you and take all your stuff, but it gets kind of repetitive after a month. Give us proper PvE content, for solos and for groups. Give us raids and something to work towards that doesn't always have PvP as the end goal. Expand the game loop into something more than just ganking or running away from gankers. I like ganking just fine, but again, it gets repetitive.
The recent faction wars update didn't add more PvE content, it just added more reasons and ways to gank. Just like Black Desert Online, I would love this game if the end game content wasn't purely about PvP. A balanced hybrid would be perfection and I would gladly sink thousands of hours into such a game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pros:
1)5V5 moba style pvp is really skillful, and really fun
2)Zerg fights (100v100, 70v70 etc) are bit stale but always feels nice that you can solo clap whole group and make your zerg win the fight, always exciting to fight big numbers
3)You can adjust your playstyle to the game. There are multiple economy, farming, gathering guilds and players in the game.
4)You can be what you want
5) NOT P2W
cons:
1)Probably one of the worst balancing teams. Can make some weapon ♥♥♥♥ for half a year, and other one can be mega OP for the exact same amount of time.
2)Zone capping / fps issues in ZvZ's
3)Game tends to go for a more ZvZ style gameplay. All these changes towards ZvZ are dictated by Blue Army at the roundtable.

Would probably be 10/10 game if balancing team werent so ♥♥♥♥.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Game forces you to group play, which is fine if that is what you're into. While I do enjoy this I would like to option to solo as well. The game is an open sandbox full loot PVP. Meaning if you die in the zones even worth doing dungeons in, you lose all your stuff. The games ""Solo"" dungeons constantly get dived by 3-5 players so you pretty much go out knowing you're going to die and lose your stuff no matter what. Fun game, but the lack of solo options killed it for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The gameplay was solid and clean, and fun one may say, but the community including the developers are totally toxic and had pushed me around. This game requires teamwork, and every guild thinks this new loner guy is a spy, so nobody can join. So why buy or play the game if you can't be part of the actual gameplay itself and guild wars...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
