good"You ever see those speedruns where folks clip into the ceiling and run along invisible floors to skip the entire game?No one tried to find those shortcuts and clips. They just happened while people were playing. No one tried to discover anything broken in this game.Also you can sell a store's own stock to them for free money and free Speech level-ups. Never gets old."very nice :DThe game is fun and there are a tones of missions to do and it gives you a menu already if you want mods you just download them and they are in the game unlike nexus where its more difficultI like being the person but would like more dialog. i like then graphics and design. This is one game I , as a 76 yr old grandma can understand thee concept of. It keeps my brain alive. I would love more lands to go to and more interaction with family and friends."Back when the original Skyrim released, I was a console pleb, due to not having a good enough PC or money to afford parts or just a PC in general. I put probably 1000+ hours into it, even without all the DLC's. Many different characters, roles, etc. I loved everything this game offered. Fast foward to now, Great PC, so I bought this. Basically non-stop playing with a few breaks here and there, plus sleep. Still the best RPG I've played to this date.Seriously, if you haven't played Skyrim at all, in all these years... do yourself a favor - play it.You won't regret it."this should be 3 dollars by nowStop breaking my SKSE with creation club updates :)"this game ruined my life!awesome!modding for 8 years""If you already played 900h of the original game, there is no point for you to buy this.However, if you're like me and never finished the original Skyrim, or you live under a rock, never heard of this and looking for something to invest your precious time into while your wife and kids are gone, this is most likely more morally acceptable than anything else you think of doing right now."
